<h2>DEDICATION.</h2>

<p class="center gothic">To my Mother.</p>

<p>As I turn over the pages of this my first book,
and mark here and there a name which use has
made familiar, I feel the more, that, but for your
sympathy and encouragement, much would still
remain unwritten. With me you have sorrowed
over the untimely death of “Little Charlie.”
“Bertha,” with her precious gifts,—whereof so
many stand in need,—has grown to you and
me not a child of fancy, but a living presence.
“Little Floy,” and the “Child of the Street,”
will recall, to your mind as to mine, the touching
lines of Mrs. Browning:—</p>

<span class="smaller">OR,<br />
HOW A MISER WAS RECLAIMED.</span></h2>

<p>Of all the houses which Martin Kendrick
owned, he used the oldest and meanest for
his own habitation. It was an old tumble-down
building, on a narrow street, which
had already lived out more than its appointed
term of service, and was no longer fit to
“cumber the ground.” But the owner still
clung to it, the more, perhaps, because, as it
stood there in its desolation, unsightly and
weather-beaten, it was no unfit emblem of
himself.</p>

<p>Martin the miser! Years of voluntary
privation, such as in most cases follow only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
in the train of the extremest penury, had
given him a claim to the appellation. It
might be somewhat inconsistent with his
natural character, that, with the exception
of the one room which he occupied, the
remainder of the large house was left tenantless.
After all, it was not so difficult to
account for. He could not bear the idea of
having immediate neighbors. Who knows
but they might seize the opportunity afforded
by his absence, and rob him of the gains of
many years, which, distrusting banks and
other places of deposit, he kept in a strong
box under his own immediate charge?</p>

<p>Martin had not always been a miser. No
one ever becomes so at once; though doubtless
the propensity to it is stronger in some
than in others. Years ago,—so many that
at this time the recollection only came to
him dimly, like the faint sound of an almost-forgotten
tune,—years ago, when the blood
of youth poured its impetuous current<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
through his veins, he married a fair girl,
whose life he had shortened by his dissipated
habits; and the indifference, and even
cruelty, to which they led.</p>

<p>The day of his wife’s death, the last remnant
of the property which he inherited
from his father escaped from his grasp.
These two events, either of which brought
its own sorrow, completely sobered him.
The abject condition to which he had reduced
himself was brought vividly to his
mind; and he formed a sudden resolution,—rushing,
as will sometimes happen, from
one extreme to the other,—that, as prodigal
as his past life had been, that which
succeeded should be sparing and penurious
in the same degree; until, at least, he had
recovered his losses, and, so far as fortune
went, was restored to the same position
which he had occupied at the commencement
of his career.</p>

<p>But it is not for man to say, “Thus far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
shalt thou go, and no farther,”—to give
himself up, body and soul, to one engrossing
pursuit, and, at the end of a limited
time, wean himself from it.</p>

<p>Habit grows by what it feeds on. It was
not long before the passion of acquisition
acquired a controlling influence over the
mind of Martin Kendrick. He reached
the point which he had prescribed for himself;
but it stayed him not. Every day his
privations, self-imposed though they were,
became more pinching, his craving for gold
more insatiable. Long ago, he had cut
himself off from all friendship,—all the
pleasures and amenities of social intercourse.
He made no visits, save to his tenants, and
those only on quarter-day. Nor were these
of an agreeable character to those favored
with them; for Martin was not a merciful
landlord. He invariably demanded the uttermost
farthing that was due; and neither
sickness nor lack of employment had the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
power for a moment to soften his heart, or
delay the execution of his purpose. His
mind was drawn into itself, and, like an
uncultivated field, was left to all the barrenness
of desolation. Such is always the case,
when a man, by his own act, shuts himself
out from his kind, foregoes their sympathy
and kind offices, and virtually says, “I am
sufficient unto myself.”</p>

<p>Martin had one child, a girl, named Florence.
At the time of the death of her
mother, she was but six years old. He had
loved her, perhaps, as much as it was in his
power to love any one; and, as long as she
remained with him, he did not withdraw
himself so entirely from human companionship.
But, at the age of seventeen years,
she became acquainted with a young man, a
mechanic, in whose favor her affections were
enlisted. He proposed for her hand; but
her father, in whom love of gold was strong,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
on account of his poverty drove him, with
scorn, from his door.</p>

<p>The young man was not to be baffled
thus. He contrived to meet Florence secretly,
and, after a while, persuaded her to
forsake her home, and unite her fortunes
with his,—with the less difficulty, since
that home offered but few attractions to one
of her age. Her father’s indignation was
extreme. All advances towards reconciliation,
on the part of the newly-wedded pair,
were received with a bitterness of scorn,
which effectually prevented their repetition.
From that time, Martin Kendrick settled
down into the cold, apathetic, and solitary
existence which has been described above.
Gradually the love of gain blotted out from
his memory the remembrance of his children,
whom he never met. They had removed
from the city, though he knew it
not; and the total amount of interest displayed
respecting them discouraged any idea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
they might have entertained of informing
him.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“It’s a cold night,” quoth Martin to himself,
as he sat before the least glimmering
which could decently be called a fire in the
apartment which he occupied. He cast a
wistful glance towards a pile of wood which
lay beside the grate. He lifted one, and
poised it for a moment, glancing meanwhile
at the fire, as if he was debating in his mind
whether he had best place it on. He shook
his head, however, as if it were too great a
piece of extravagance to be thought of, and
softly laid it back. He then moved his
chair nearer to the fire as if satisfied that
this would produce the additional warmth
without the drawback of expense.</p>

<p>It was, indeed, a cold night. The chill
blasts swept with relentless rigor through
the streets, sending travellers home with
quickened pace, and causing the guardians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
of the public peace, as they stood at their
appointed stations, to wrap their overcoats
more closely about them. On many a hearth
the fire blazed brightly, in composed defiance
of the insidious visitor who shuns the abodes
of opulence, but forces his unwelcome entry
into the habitations of the poor.</p>

<p>A child, thinly clad, was roaming through
the streets. Every gust, as it swept along,
chilled her through and through; and at
length, unable to go farther, she sank down
at the portal of Martin Kendrick’s dwelling.
Extreme cold gave her courage; and, with
trembling hand, she lifted the huge knocker.
It fell from her nerveless grasp, and the
unwonted sound penetrated into the room
where Martin sat cowering over his feeble
fire. He was startled, terrified even, as that
sound came to his ears, echoing through the
empty rooms in the old house.</p>

<p>“Who can it be?—robbers?” thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
he, as he walked to the door. “I will wait
and see if it be repeated.”</p>

<p>It was repeated.</p>

<p>“Who’s there?” he exclaimed, in a
somewhat tremulous voice, as he stood
with his hand upon the latch.</p>

<p>“It’s me,” said a low, shivering voice
from without.</p>

<p>“And who’s ‘me’?”</p>

<p>“Floy,—little Floy,” was the answer.</p>

<p>“And what do you want here at this time
of night?”</p>

<p>“I am freezing. Let me come in and sit
by the fire, if only for a moment. I shall
die upon your steps.”</p>

<p>The old man deliberated.</p>

<p>“You’re sure you’re not trying to get in
after my money, what little I have? There
isn’t any one with you, is there?”</p>

<p>“No one. There is only me. Oh, sir,
do let me in! I am so cold!”</p>

<p>The bolt was cautiously withdrawn; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
Martin, opening a crack, peered forth suspiciously.
But the only object that met his
gaze was a little girl, of ten years of age,
crouching on the steps in a way to avail herself
of all the natural warmth she had.</p>

<p>“Will you let me come in?” said she,
imploringly.</p>

<p>“You had better go somewhere else. I
haven’t much of a fire. I don’t keep much,
it burns out fuel so fast. You had better go
where they keep better fires.”</p>

<p>“Oh, sir, the least fire will relieve me so
much! and I haven’t strength to go any
farther.”</p>

<p>“Well, you may come in, if you’re sure
you haven’t come to steal any thing.”</p>

<p>“I never steal: it’s wicked.”</p>

<p>“Umph! Well, I hope you’ll remember
it. This is the way.”</p>

<p>He led her into a little room which he
occupied. She sprang to the fire, little inviting
as it was, and eagerly spread out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
both hands before it. She seemed actually
to drink in the heat, scanty as it was, so
welcome did it prove to her chilled and
benumbed limbs.</p>

<p>A touch of humanity came to the miser,
or perhaps his own experience of the cold
stimulated him to the act; for, after a few
minutes’ deliberation, he took two sticks
from the pile of fuel, and threw them upon
the fire. They crackled and burnt; diffusing,
for a time, a cheerful warmth about
the apartment. The little girl looked up
gratefully, and thanked him for what she
regarded as an act of kindness to herself.</p>

<p>“Fuel’s high, very high; and it takes a
fearful quantity to keep the fire agoing.”</p>

<p>“But what a pleasant fire it makes!” said
the little girl, as she looked at the flames
curling aloft.</p>

<p>“Why, yes,” said Martin, in a soliloquising
tone, “it is comfortable; but it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
would not do to have it burn so bright.
It would ruin me completely.”</p>

<p>“Then you are poor?” said the little
girl, looking about the room. The furniture
was scanty; consisting only of the
most indispensable articles, and those of
the cheapest kind. They had all been
picked up, at second-hand stores, for little
or nothing.</p>

<p>It was no wonder that little Floy asked the
question. Nevertheless, the miser looked
suspiciously at her, as if there was some
covert meaning in her words. But she
looked so openly and frankly at him as
quite to disarm any suspicions he might
entertain.</p>

<p>“Poor?” he at length answered. “Yes,
I am; or should be, if I plunged into extravagant
living and expenses of every kind.”
And he looked half regretfully at the sticks
which had burned out, and were now smouldering
in the grate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well,” said Floy, “I am poor too, and
so were father and mother. But I think I
am poorer than you; for I have no home at
all, no house to live in, and no fire to keep
me warm.”</p>

<p>“Then where do you live?” asked the
miser.</p>

<p>“I don’t live anywhere,” said the child,
simply.</p>

<p>“But where do you stay?”</p>

<p>“Where I can. I generally walk about
the streets in the daytime; and, when I feel
cold, I go into some store to warm myself.
They don’t always let me stay long. They
call me ragged, and a beggar. I suppose,”
she continued, casting a glance at her thin
dress, which in some places was torn and
dirty from long wearing,—“I suppose it’s
all true; but I can’t help it.”</p>

<p>“Where do you think of going to-night?”
asked Martin, abruptly.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I haven’t any place to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
go to; and it’s very cold. Won’t you let
me stay here?” asked the child, imploringly.</p>

<p>The miser started.</p>

<p>“How can you stay here? Here is only
one room, and this I occupy.”</p>

<p>“Let me lie down on the floor, anywhere.
It will be better than to go out into the cold
streets.”</p>

<p>The miser paused. Even he, callous as
his heart had become, would not willingly
thrust out a young girl into the street,
where in all probability, unless succor
came, she would perish from the severity of
the weather.</p>

<p>After a little consideration, he took the
fragment of a candle which was burning on
the table, and, bidding Floy follow him, led
the way into a room near by, which was
quite destitute of furniture, save a small
cot-bed in the corner. It had been left
there when Martin Kendrick first took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
possession of the house, and had remained
undisturbed ever since. A quilt, which,
though tattered, was still thick and warm,
was spread over it.</p>

<p>“There,” said Martin, pointing it out to
Floy, who followed him closely,—“there is
a bed. It hasn’t been slept on for a great
many years; but I suppose it will do as
well as any other. You can sleep there,
if you want to.”</p>

<p>“Then I shall have a bed to sleep in!”
said Floy, joyfully. “It is some time since
I slept on any thing softer than a board, or
perhaps a rug.”</p>

<p>Martin was about to leave her alone,
when he chanced to think the room would
be dark.</p>

<p>“You can undress in the dark, can’t
you?” he inquired. “I haven’t got but
one light. I can’t afford to keep more.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I sha’n’t take off my clothes at all,”
said the young girl. “I never do.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>She got into bed, spread the quilt over her,
and was asleep in less than five minutes.</p>

<p>Martin Kendrick went back to his room.
He did not immediately retire to bed, but
sat for a few minutes, pondering on the
extraordinary chance—for in his case it
was certainly extraordinary—which had
thrown a young girl, as it were, under his
protection, though but for a limited time.
He was somewhat bewildered, so unexpectedly
had the event happened, and could
scarcely, even now, realize that it was so.</p>

<p>But the warning sound of a neighboring
church-clock, as it proclaimed midnight, interrupted
the train of his reflections, and
he prepared for bed; not neglecting, so
strongly was the feeling of suspicion implanted
in him, to secure the door by means
of a bolt. When he awoke, the sun was
shining through the window of his room.
He had hardly dressed himself, when a faint
knock was heard at the door of his room.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
Opening it a little ways, he saw Floy standing
before him.</p>

<p>“What! you here now?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“Yes. Where should I go? Besides, I
did not want to unlock the front door without
your permission.”</p>

<p>“That is quite right,” said Martin.
“Some one, who was ill-disposed, might
have entered and stolen,—that is, if he
could have found any thing worth taking.”</p>

<p>“And now, sir, if you please, I’ll make
your bed,” said the child, entering the room.
“I’ve made the one I slept in.”</p>

<p>Martin looked on without a word; while
Floy, taking his silence for assent, proceeded
to roll back the clothes, shake the bed vigorously,
and then spread them over again.
Espying a broom at one corner of the room,
she took it, and swept up the hearth neatly.
She then glanced towards the miser, who had
been watching her motions, as if to ascertain
whether they met with his approval.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>“So you can work?” said he, after a
pause.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! mother used to teach me. I
wish,” said she, after a while, brightening
up, as if struck with a new idea,—“I wish
you would let me stay here: I would make
your bed, take care of your room, and keep
every thing nice. Besides, I could get your
dinners.”</p>

<p>“Stay with me! Impossible. I don’t
have much to do: besides, I couldn’t afford
it.”</p>

<p>“It won’t cost you any thing,” said Floy,
earnestly. “I know how to sew; and,
when I am not doing something for you, I
can sew for money, and give it to you.”</p>

<p>This idea seemed to produce some impression
upon the old miser’s mind.</p>

<p>“But how do I know,” said he, a portion
of his old suspicions returning,—“how do
I know but you will steal off some day, and
carry something with you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>“I never steal,” said Floy, half indignantly.
“Besides, I have no place to go
to, if I should leave here.”</p>

<p>This was true; and Martin, considering
that it would be against her interest to injure
him in any such way,—an argument which
weighed more heavily than any protestations
on her part would have done,—at length
said,—</p>

<p>“Well, you may stay,—at least, a while.
I suppose you are hungry. There’s a loaf
of bread in the closet. You may eat some
of it; but don’t eat too much. It’s—it’s
hurtful to the health to eat too much.”</p>

<p>“When will you be home to get some
dinner?” asked the child.</p>

<p>“About noon. Perhaps I will bring some
sewing for you to do.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I hope you will! It will seem so
nice not to be obliged to be walking about
the streets, but to be seated in a pleasant
room, sewing!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>When Martin came home at noon, instead
of finding the room cheerless and cold, as had
been his wont, the fire was burning brightly,
diffusing a pleasant warmth about the apartment.
Floy had set the table in the centre
of the room,—with some difficulty it must
be confessed; for it was rickety, and would
not stand even, owing to one of the legs
being shorter than the rest. This, however,
she had remedied by placing a chip under
the deficient member. There was no cloth
on; for this was an article which Martin did
not number among his possessions. Floy
had substituted two towels, which, united,
covered perhaps half the table.</p>

<p>A portion of the loaf—for there was but
one—she had toasted by the fire, and this
had been placed on a separate plate from the
other. On the whole, therefore, though it
was far from being a sumptuous repast,
every thing looked clean and neat; and this
alone adds increased zest to the appetite. At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
least, Martin felt more of an appetite than
usual; and, between them, the two despatched
all that had been provided.</p>

<p>“Is there any more bread in the closet?”
asked Martin.</p>

<p>“No,” said Floy: “it is all gone.”</p>

<p>“Then I must bring some home when I
return to supper.”</p>

<p>“I have been thinking,” said Floy, hesitatingly,
“that, if you would trust me to do
it, and would bring home the materials, I
would make some bread; and that would
be cheaper than buying it; and, besides, it
would give me something to do.”</p>

<p>“What!” asked Martin, as he looked,
with an air of surprise, at the diminutive
form of little Floy, “do you know how to
make bread? How came a child like you
to learn?”</p>

<p>“Mother used to be sick a good deal,”
said Floy, “and was confined to her bed,
so that she could do nothing herself. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
used to direct me what to do; so that, after
a while, I came to know how to cook as well
as she.”</p>

<p>“Well, what shall I have to bring home?”
asked the miser, whom the hint of its being
cheaper had enlisted in favor of the plan.</p>

<p>“Let me see,” said Floy, as she sat down
and began to reflect: “there’s flour and saleratus
and salt. But we’ve got the salt; so
you need only get the first two.”</p>

<p>“Very well; I will attend to it. Oh! I
forgot to ask what sewing you knew how to
do. Can you make shirts?”</p>

<p>“Yes; I have made a good many.”</p>

<p>“Then I will bring you home some to-night,
if I can get any.”</p>

<p>When she had cleared away the dinner-dishes,
washed them, and put them in the
closet,—an operation which the simplicity
of the meal rendered but a short one,—Floy
began to look round her, to see what
else she could do. A desire seized her to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
explore the old house, of which so many
rooms had for years remained deserted.
They were bare and desolate, inhabited only
by spiders and crickets, who occupied them
rent free. It might have been years, perhaps,
since they had echoed to the steps of a
human foot. They looked dark and gloomy
enough to have been witness to many a dark
deed of midnight assassination. But it was
all fancy, doubtless; and in little Floy they
produced no other feeling than that of chilliness.
She rummaged all the closets with
a feeling of curiosity, but found nothing in
any one of them to reward her search until
she came to the last. There was a large
roll of something on the floor, which, on
examination, proved to be a small carpet,
quite dirty, and somewhat moth-eaten. It
had probably been left there inadvertently,
and remained undiscovered until the present
moment. Floy spread it out, and
examined it critically. An idea struck her,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
which she hastened to put into execution.
Threading her way back to the miser’s
room, she procured a stout stick which stood
in the corner, and, going back, gave the carpet
a sound drubbing, which nearly stifled
her with dust. Nevertheless, she persevered,
and soon got it into quite a respectable
state of cleanness. She then managed,
by a considerable effort, to lug it to Martin’s
room, and, in an hour or so, had spread it
out, and finally fastened it by means of some
tacks which she found in one corner of the
closet. The effect was certainly wonderful.
The carpet actually gave the room a very
cosy and comfortable appearance; and little
Floy took considerable credit to herself for
the metamorphosis.</p>

<p>“What will he say?” thought she. “I
wonder whether he will be pleased.”</p>

<p>It was but a few minutes after this change
had been effected that Martin came in. It
was about three o’clock,—sooner than Floy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
expected him; but he had thought she might
require the materials early, in order to make
preparations for the evening meal.</p>

<p>As he opened the door, he started back in
surprise at the changed appearance of the
room. It occurred to him, for a moment,
that he had strayed into the wrong place;
but the sight of Floy, sitting at the window,
re-assured him, and he went in.</p>

<p>“What is all this?” he inquired in a
bewildered tone.</p>

<p>Floy enjoyed his surprise. She told him
in what manner she had effected the change,
and asked him if he did not like it.</p>

<p>He could not do otherwise than answer
in the affirmative; and, in truth, an unusual
sense of comfort came over him as he sat
down and looked about him.</p>

<p>Floy had taken possession of the flour,
and was already kneading it.</p>

<p>“Now,” said she, after this was done, “I
must put it down by the fire to rise; that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
will not take long; and then it will be ready
to bake.”</p>

<p>“Have you got any shirts for me?” she
inquired after a while.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Martin, recollecting himself,
and unrolling a bundle which he had placed
on the table. “There are half a dozen for
you to begin on; and, if you do them well,
you can have some more.”</p>

<p>Floy looked pleased.</p>

<p>“Now,” said she, “I shall have something
to do when you are away.”</p>

<p>“You like to be doing something?” said
Martin, inquiringly.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! I can’t bear to be idle.”</p>

<p>Martin did not go out again that afternoon.
About six o’clock, Floy set the table,
and placed upon it a plate of warm cakes
which might have pleased the palate of an
epicure. It was the best meal the miser had
tasted for years, and he could not help confessing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
it to himself. Floy was gratified at
the appetite with which he ate.</p>

<p>Thus matters went on. The presence of
the little girl seemed to restore Martin to a
part of his former self. He was no longer
so grasping and miserly as before. Through
little Floy’s ministry, he began to have
more of a relish for the comforts of life,
and less to grudge the expense necessary
to obtain them.</p>

<p>It was not many weeks before he fell sick,
in consequence of imprudent exposure to
the rain. At first he did not regard it; but
a fever set in, and he was confined to his
bed.</p>

<p>At the urgent solicitation of Floy, he consented
to have a physician called, though
not without something of reluctance at the
thought of the fee.</p>

<p>Then it was that he began to appreciate
more fully the importance of Floy’s services.
Ever ready to minister to his wants, no one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
could wish a more faithful or attentive nurse.
As she sat by his bedside in the long days
through which his sickness was protracted,
busily engaged with her sewing, he would
lie for hours, watching the motion of her
busy fingers with pleased interest. Occasionally—for
he had nothing else to do—his
mind would wander back to the scenes
of his early manhood, and he would sigh
over the recollection of the happiness which
might have been his. Then his thoughts
would be borne along the dreamy years
which had intervened, unlighted by the rays
of friendship, and uncheered by the presence
of affection. The image of his daughter,
whom he had cast off, and of whose after-fate
he knew nothing, came up before him,
and he could not repel it. A change, a
beneficial and salutary change, was rolling
over his mind,—the fruit of those long
involuntary hours of sickness and self-communing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>On the first day succeeding his recovery,
he invited Floy to go out with him. It was
an unusual request, and Floy hardly knew
what to make of it. She got her bonnet,
however (for shawl she had none), and complied.
It was a chilly March day, and the
thin dress which she had worn from the time
of her coming to Kendrick’s was but an ill
protection against the weather. She shivered
involuntarily.</p>

<p>“You are cold,” said Martin; “but you
will not need to go far.”</p>

<p>He led the way into a dry-goods store.</p>

<p>“Have you any warm shawls suitable for
a little girl?” he inquired. He selected
one, and paid for it. “Show me some dress-patterns,”
he continued.</p>

<p>Two different ones were chosen. Martin
paid for them.</p>

<p>“Can you direct me,” he inquired, “to
any good dressmaker’s?”</p>

<p>The clerk had at first been inclined to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
laugh at the old man, whose attire, though
warmer, was no better looking than Floy’s;
but the promptness with which he paid for
his purchases, and the glimpse which had
in this way been obtained of a well-filled
pocket-book, inspired him with a feeling of
respect, and he readily complied with his
request.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Martin cheerfully to Floy,
“we will have you a little better dressed, so
that you need not fear the cold.”</p>

<p>“I am sure,” said Floy, gratefully, “that
I am much obliged, and I don’t know how I
can repay you.”</p>

<p>“You have already,” said the old man
with feeling. “I don’t know how I should
have got along without you when I was
sick.”</p>

<p>“Floy,” said Martin, thoughtfully, as they
came out from the dressmaker’s, “although
you have been with me for some time, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
have never thought to ask your name,—I
mean your other name besides Floy.”</p>

<p>“My name is not Floy,” said the child.
“They only call me so. My real name is
Florence,—Florence Eastman.”</p>

<p>“Florence Eastman!” said the old man,
starting back in uncontrollable agitation.
“Who was your mother? Tell me quick!”</p>

<p>“Her name,” said the child, somewhat
surprised, “was Florence Kendrick.”</p>

<p>“Who was her father?”</p>

<p>“Martin Kendrick.”</p>

<p>“And where is he? Did you ever see
him?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Floy, shaking her head. “He
was angry with mother for marrying as she
did, and would never see any of us.”</p>

<p>“And your mother?” said Martin, striving
to be calm. “Is she dead?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Floy, sorrowfully. “First,
my father died, and we were left very poor.
Then mother was obliged to work very hard,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
sewing; and finally she took a fever, and
died, leaving me alone in the world. For a
week, I wandered about without a home;
but at last you took me in. I don’t know
what would have become of me if you had
not,” said she, gratefully.</p>

<p>“Floy,” said Martin, looking at her steadfastly,
“do you know my name?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Floy. “I have often wondered
what it was, but never liked to ask
you.”</p>

<p>“Then,” said he, in an agitated tone,
“you shall know now. I am Martin Kendrick,
your <span class="smcapuc">GRANDFATHER</span>!”</p>

<p>Floy was filled with amazement, but, after
a moment, threw herself into his arms.
“Will you forgive mother?” she asked.</p>

<p>“I will! I have! But, alas! she has
much more to forgive me. Would that she
were still alive!”</p>

<p>Every day, Martin Kendrick became more
alive to the claims of affection. His miserly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
habits gave way, and he became more considerate
in his dealings with his tenants.
The old house, in which he lived so many
years, was torn down; and he bought a neat
cottage just out of the city, where he and
Floy live happily together. Floy, who has
been sent to school, exhibits uncommon
talent, and is fitting for the station she
will soon assume as the heiress of her
grandfather.</p>

THANKSGIVING DAY.</h2>

<p>Thanksgiving Day dawned clearly and
frostily upon the little village of Castleton
Hollow. The stage which connected daily
with the nearest railroad station (for as yet
Castleton Hollow had not arrived at the dignity
of one of its own) came fully freighted,
both inside and out. There were children
and children’s children, who, in the pursuit
of fortune, had strayed away from the homes
where they first saw the light; but who were
now returning, to revive, around the old
familiar hearth, the associations and recollections
of their early days.</p>

<p>Great were the preparations among the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
housewives of Castleton Hollow. That
must indeed be a poor household which,
on this occasion, could not boast its turkey
and plum-pudding,—those well-established
dishes; not to mention its long rows of pies,—apple,
mince, and pumpkin,—wherewith
the Thanksgiving board is wont to be
garnished.</p>

<p>But it is not of the households generally
that I propose to speak. Let the reader
accompany me, in imagination, to a rather
prim-looking brick mansion, situated on the
principal street, but at some distance back,
being separated from it by a front yard.
Between this yard and the fence ran a prim-looking
hedge, of very formal cut, being
cropped in the most careful manner, lest
one twig should, by chance, have the presumption
to grow higher than its kindred.
It was a two-story house, containing in each
story one room on either side of the front
door; making, of course, four in all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>If we go in, we shall find the outward
primness well supported by the appearance
of things within. In the front parlor—we
may peep through the door, but it would be
high treason, in the present moistened state
of our boots, to step within its sacred precincts—there
are six high-backed chairs
standing in state, two at each window. One
can easily see, from the general arrangement
of the furniture, that from romping children,
unceremonious kittens, and unhallowed intruders
generally, this room is most sacredly
guarded.</p>

<p>Without speaking particularly of the other
rooms,—which, though not furnished in so
stately a manner, bear a family resemblance
to “the best room,”—we will usher the
reader into the opposite room, where he
will find the owner and occupant of this
prim-looking residence.</p>

<p>Courteous reader! Miss Hetty Henderson.
Miss Hetty Henderson, let me make you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
acquainted with this lady (or gentleman),
who is desirous of knowing you better.</p>

<p>Miss Hetty Henderson, with whom the
reader has just passed through the ceremony
of introduction, is a maiden of some
thirty-five summers, attired in a sober-looking
dress of irreproachable neatness, but
most formal cut. She is the only occupant
of the house, of which, likewise, she is
proprietor. Her father, who was the village
physician, died some ten years since; leaving
to Hetty,—or perhaps I should give
her full name, Henrietta,—his only child,
the house in which he lived, and some four
thousand dollars in bank-stock, on the income
of which she lived very comfortably.</p>

<p>Somehow, Miss Hetty had never married;
though, such is the mercenary nature of man,
the rumor of her inheritance brought to her
feet several suitors. But Miss Hetty had
resolved never to marry,—at least, this was
her invariable answer to matrimonial offers;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
and so, after a time, it came to be understood
that she was fixed for life,—an old
maid. What reasons impelled her to this
course were not known; but possibly the
reader will be furnished with a clew before
he finishes this narrative.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the invariable effect of a
single and solitary life combined attended
Hetty. She grew precise, prim, and methodical,
to a painful degree. It would have
been quite a relief if one could have detected
a stray thread even upon her well-swept
carpet; but such was never the case.</p>

<p>On this particular day,—this Thanksgiving
Day of which we are speaking,—Miss
Hetty had completed her culinary preparations;
that is, she had stuffed her turkey
and put it in the oven, and kneaded her
pudding; for, though she knew that but
one would be present at the dinner, her
conscience would scarcely have acquitted
her if she had not made all the preparations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
to which she had been accustomed on such
occasions.</p>

<p>This done, she sat down to her knitting;
casting a glance every now and then at the
oven, to make sure that all was going on
well. It was a quiet morning; and Miss
Hetty’s thoughts kept time to the clicking
of her knitting-needles.</p>

<p>“After all,” thought she, “it’s rather
solitary taking dinner alone, and that on
Thanksgiving Day. I remember, a long
time ago, when my father and my brothers
and sisters were living, what a merry time
we used to have round the table. But they
are all dead; and I—I alone—am left.”</p>

<p>Miss Hetty sighed; but, after a while,
the recollections of those old times returned.
She tried to shake them off; but they had a
fascination about them, after all, and would
not go at her bidding.</p>

<p>“There used to be another there,” thought
she,—“Nick Anderson. He too, I fear, is
dead.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>Hetty heaved a thoughtful sigh, and a
faint color came into her cheeks. She had
reason. This Nicholas Anderson had been
a medical student, apprenticed to her father;
or rather placed with him, to be prepared for
his profession. He was perhaps a year older
than Hetty, and had regarded her with more
than ordinary warmth of affection. He had,
in fact, proposed to her, and had been conditionally
accepted on a year’s probation.
The trouble was, he was a little disposed to
be wild, and, being naturally of a lively and
careless temperament, did not exercise sufficient
discrimination in the choice of his
associates. Hetty had loved him as warmly
as one of her nature could love. She was
not one who would be drawn away beyond
the dictates of reason and judgment by the
force of affection. Still, it was not without
a feeling of deep sorrow,—deeper than her
calm manner led him to suspect,—that, at
the end of the year’s probation, she informed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
Anderson that the result of his trial was not
favorable to his suit, and that henceforth he
must give up all thoughts of her.</p>

<p>To his vehement asseverations, promises,
and protestations, she returned the same
steady and inflexible answer; and, at the
close of the interview, he left her, quite as
full of indignation against her as of grief
for his rejection.</p>

<p>That night, his clothing was packed up,
and lowered from the window; and, when
the next morning dawned, it was found that
he had left the house, never, as was intimated
in a slight note pencilled and left on the
table in his room, to return again.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>While Miss Henderson’s mind was far
back in the past, she had not observed the
approach of a man, shabbily attired, accompanied
by a little girl apparently some eight
years of age. The man’s face bore the impress
of many cares and hardships. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
little girl was of delicate appearance; and
an occasional shiver showed that her garments
were too thin to protect her sufficiently
from the inclemency of the weather.</p>

<p>“This is the place, Henrietta,” said the
traveller at length, pausing at the head of
the gravelled walk which led up to the front
door of the prim-looking brick house.</p>

<p>Together they entered; and a moment
afterwards, just as Miss Hetty was preparing
to lay the cloth for dinner, a knock sounded
through the house.</p>

<p>“Goodness!” said Miss Hetty, fluttered.
“Who can it be that wants to see me at this
hour?”</p>

<p>Smoothing down her apron, and giving a
look at the glass to make sure that her hair
was in order, she hastened to the door.</p>

<p>“Will it be asking too much, madam, to
request a seat by your fire for myself and
little girl for a few moments? It is very
cold.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>Miss Hetty could feel that it <em>was</em> cold.
Somehow, too, the appealing expression of
the little girl’s face touched her. So she
threw the door wide open, and bade them
enter.</p>

<p>Miss Hetty went on preparing the table
for dinner. A most delightful odor issued
from the oven; one door of which was open,
lest the turkey should overdo. Miss Hetty
could not help observing the wistful glance
cast by the little girl towards the tempting
dish as she placed it on the table.</p>

<p>“Poor little creature!” thought she. “I
suppose it is a long time since she has had
a good dinner.”</p>

<p>Then the thought struck her, “Here I
am alone to eat all this. There is quite
enough for half a dozen. How much these
poor people would relish it!”</p>

<p>By this time the table was arranged.</p>

<p>“Sir,” said she, turning to the traveller,
“you look as if you were hungry as well as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
cold. If you and your little daughter would
like to sit up, I should be happy to have
you.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, madam!” was the grateful
reply. “We are hungry, and shall be
much indebted to your kindness.”</p>

<p>It was rather a novel situation for Miss
Hetty,—sitting at the head of the table,
dispensing food to others beside herself.
There was something rather agreeable about
it.</p>

<p>“Will you have some of the dressing,
little girl? I have to call you that; for I
don’t know your name,” she added, in an
inquiring tone.</p>

<p>“Her name is Henrietta; but I generally
call her Hetty,” said the traveller.</p>

<p>“What!” said Miss Hetty, dropping the
spoon in surprise.</p>

<p>“She was named after a very dear friend
of mine,” said he, sighing.</p>

<p>“May I ask,” said Miss Hetty, with excusable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
curiosity, “the name of this friend?
I begin to feel quite an interest in your little
girl,” she added, half apologetically.</p>

<p>“Her name is Henrietta Henderson,”
said the stranger.</p>

<p>“Why, that is my name!” ejaculated
Miss Hetty.</p>

<p>“And she was named after you,” said the
stranger, composedly.</p>

<p>“Why, who in the world are you?” she
asked, her heart beginning to beat unwontedly
fast.</p>

<p>“Then you don’t remember me?” said
he, rising, and looking steadily at Miss
Hetty. “Yet you knew me well in bygone
days,—none better. At one time, it
was thought you would join your destiny
to mine——”</p>

<p>“Nick Anderson!” said Miss Hetty, rising
in confusion.</p>

<p>“You are right. You rejected me because
you did not feel secure of my principles.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
The next day, in despair at your
refusal, I left the house, and, ere forty-eight
hours had passed, was on my way to India.
I had not formed the design of going to
India in particular; but, in my then state
of mind, I cared not whither I went. One
resolution I formed,—that I would prove
by my conduct that your apprehensions were
ill founded. I got into a profitable business.
In time, I married; not that I had forgotten
you, but that I was solitary, and needed
companionship. I had ceased to hope for
yours. By and by, a daughter was born.
True to my old love, I named her Hetty,
and pleased myself with the thought that
she bore some resemblance to you. Afterwards
my wife died; misfortunes came upon
me; and I found myself deprived of all
my property. Then came yearnings for
my native soil. I have returned (as you
see), not as I departed, but poor and care-worn.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>While Nicholas was speaking, Miss Hetty’s
mind was filled with conflicting emotions.
At length, extending her hand frankly, she
said,—</p>

<p>“I feel that I was too hasty, Nicholas. I
should have tried you longer. But, at least,
I may repair my injustice. I have enough
for us all. You shall come and live with
me.”</p>

<p>“I can only accept your generous offer
on one condition,” said Nicholas.</p>

<p>“And what is that?”</p>

<p>“That you will be my wife!”</p>

<p>A vivid blush came over Miss Hetty’s
countenance. She “couldn’t think of such
a thing,” she said. Nevertheless, an hour
afterwards the two united lovers had fixed
upon the marriage-day.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The house does not look so prim as it
used to do. The yard is redolent with
many fragrant flowers. The front door is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
half open, revealing a little girl playing
with a kitten.</p>

<p>“Hetty,” says a matronly lady, “you
have got the ball of yarn all over the floor.
What would your father say if he should
see it?”</p>

<p>“Never mind, mother; it was only kitty
that did it.”</p>

<p>Marriage has filled up a void in the heart
of Miss Hetty. Though not so prim, or
perhaps careful, as she used to be, she is a
good deal happier. Three hearts are filled
with thankfulness at every return of <span class="smcap">Miss
Henderson’s Thanksgiving Day</span>.</p>

<h2 id="BERTHAS_CHRISTMAS_VISION">BERTHA’S CHRISTMAS VISION.</h2>

<p>It was the night before Christmas. Snow
was falling without; and the wind dashed
the cold flakes, in eddying whirls, into the
faces of those wayfarers whom business or
pleasure kept out thus late. They drew
their warm garments more closely about
them, and hurried onward; little heeding
the pelting of the storm while the vision of
a cheerful hearth and a merry family circle
danced before their eyes and warmed their
hearts. Merry St. Nicholas, too, the patron
saint of children, was abroad. It was a
busy night with him. Thousands of parcels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
must be made up, and showered down as
many chimneys into expectant stockings,
before the morrow’s dawn. So he gives
the reins to his coursers, and speeds swiftly
along,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent12">“through forest and brake;</div>
<div class="verse">Through deep, drifting snow; over river and lake;</div>
<div class="verse">Over hill, over dale, where the keen northern blast,</div>
<div class="verse">With fierce, angry moaning, drives fearfully past.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In a large and pleasant room sat little
Bertha, gazing thoughtfully into the fire.
The fire crackled and burnt; and shadows,
cast by its flickering light, danced on the
wall. But little Bertha’s thoughts were far
away, and she heeded them not. For many
weeks, she had been looking forward to this
very night; and now she was trying to conjecture
what gifts good St. Nicholas had in
store for her. At length she grew weary
of conjecture, took a lamp from the table,
and went up stairs to bed. It was a neat
little chamber; and the counterpane on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
Bertha’s bed rivalled in whiteness the falling
snow without. Bertha looked out of
the window, against the panes of which the
snow was beating noisily.</p>

<p>“It is a cold night,” thought she. “St.
Nicholas will have a hard time of it. What
if he should not come at all?”</p>

<p>Bertha’s apprehensions were soon dispelled;
for, as she looked out, the sound
of silvery bells came nearer and nearer, till
at length it paused under her window, and,
a moment afterwards, was heard in an opposite
direction. Bertha rubbed her eyes,
and strove to distinguish the sleigh from
which these sounds proceeded; but she
could distinguish nothing.</p>

<p>“Can it be St. Nicholas?” thought she.</p>

<p>Even as she spoke, mingling with the
sound of the retreating bells, she thought
she could distinguish the words of a song.
She listened attentively; and these were the
words which the wind bore to her:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“I glide o’er the mountain,</div>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>
<p>“That must certainly be Santa Claus,”
thought Bertha. So she carefully hung up
her stockings before the fire, and went to
bed. She soon became tired of waiting for
St. Nicholas to come; and, in a few minutes,
she was asleep. But the thoughts of Christmas
had taken fast hold of her mind, and,
as she slept, shaped themselves into the following
dream:—</p>

<p>She thought, that, as she was lying awake
in her chamber, there appeared suddenly
before her three figures, clad in white.
Slowly they advanced, hand in hand, till
they stood before her bedside. Then, with
united voices, they chanted the following
lines:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Maiden, from the fields of air</div>
<div class="verse indent1">We have winged our rapid flight,</div>
<div class="verse">Bringing gifts both rich and rare,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">On this frosty Christmas night.</div>
<div class="verse">Guard them ever: they will be</div>
<div class="verse">Of exceeding worth to thee.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>
<p>They ceased; and Bertha, in great astonishment,
inquired,—</p>

<p>“What! are you St. Nicholas? Or,” she
added, recollecting herself, “perhaps you
are his sisters?”</p>

<p>The visitors resumed their chant:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Maiden, no! Thy Christmas saint</div>
<div class="verse">Beareth gifts of mortal taint:</div>
<div class="verse">At the touch of sure decay</div>
<div class="verse">They shall vanish quite away.</div>
<div class="verse">Those we bear are not of earth:</div>
<div class="verse">Theirs has been a higher birth.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The visitors ceased; and one of their
number, coming forward, commenced
anew:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“I am Faith. To thee I bear</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Childlike trust and confidence</div>
<div class="verse">In the ever-watchful care</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Of our Father’s providence.</div>
<div class="verse">Maiden, one of sisters three,</div>
<div class="verse">This the gift I bear to thee.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>
<p>The second came forward, and repeated:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“I am Hope. When darksome clouds</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Gather round thy earthly way,</div>

<div class="verse">Maiden, one of sisters three,</div>
<div class="verse">This the gift I bear to thee.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Smiling graciously on the wondering Bertha,
Hope drew back, and gave place to her
sister, who commenced as follows:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“I am Charity. Let me</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Ever on thy steps attend,</div>

<div class="verse">In thy bosom I would sow</div>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>
<p>Again the sisters joined hands, and, with
united voices, chanted, as at first,—</p>

<p>Their voices died away, and they were
gone. Bertha opened her eyes, and, lo! it
was all a vision that had come to her on this
Christmas night. The morning sun was
shining brightly through the window-panes.
Noisily over the frozen snow dashed the
sleighs; and their bells rang a merry peal
in honor of Christmas Day. Bertha glanced
at the well-filled stockings that hung in
front of the fire, and then she knew that
St. Nicholas had been there with his budget
of gifts; and the words sung by the sisters
came into her mind:—</p>

<div class="verse">Theirs has been a higher birth.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“I will not forget the gifts of the good
sisters,” she murmured softly. “Doubtless
it is my heavenly Father who has sent them
to me.”</p>

<p>So it was that little Bertha, attended by
the three sisters, walked peacefully and happily
through life.</p>

<p>The ways of God’s providence, so dark
and mysterious to many, became plain and
clear to her; for she saw with the eye of
Faith. Clouds sometimes gathered about
her path; but Hope waved her wand, and
they were at once dispelled. Jealousy and
envy and angry thoughts disturbed her not;
for her heart was filled with the heavenly
spirit of Charity.</p>

<p>Would that we all might be blessed with
Bertha’s Christmas vision!</p>

<h2 id="WIDE-AWAKE">WIDE-AWAKE.</h2>

<p>Many years ago, in a city whose name I
cannot now recall, there lived a poor woman,
whose husband had died, leaving nothing
but a little son. For some time, she continued
to support herself, and her son, whom
she dearly loved, by working early and late
at the spinning-wheel. But, after a while,
a heavy misfortune fell upon her: it was no
less than the loss of eyesight. So she was
obliged to give up her spinning; for now
she could distinguish neither the web nor
the woof. You can imagine her distress at
being deprived so suddenly of seeing the
great and beautiful spectacle of fields, flowers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
and sky, which every day presents to
our gaze. Still, she would not have heeded
all this; but she found herself cut off, at
the same time, from all means of subsistence.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, her son had grown up into a
stout, active boy of twelve. He was full of
life and animation; and that, I suppose, was
the reason he had received the name of
“Wide-awake.” Now, little Wide-awake
had a kind heart as well as manly spirit;
and when he saw that his mother, who had
worked so hard and so long for him, had
become blind, he said to himself, “Now it
is my turn to work.”</p>

<p>So he told his mother that he was going
to seek for work, and that, after three
months, he would faithfully return. But
first he sold the spinning-wheel, which was
no longer of any use, and one or two other
articles, and gave the money to a neighbor,
who promised to spend it for his mother as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
she had need. Then he took a cheerful
leave of his mother, and went off with a
light heart, though his pockets were empty.</p>

<p>He had not walked far when he overtook
an old woman, who was bending beneath the
weight of a heavy burden. She was homely,
and appeared very tired. Wide-awake was
passing by, when she called out to him,
“Come here, little boy: help me to carry
this bundle. I am old, weak, and tired;
you are young and strong.”</p>

<p>Wide-awake was very obliging; and,
though the old woman’s tone was not the
pleasantest in the world, he very willingly
took one side of the bundle, and helped her
to carry it. The day was hot, and the bundle
heavy; but he bore up stoutly, so that the
old woman began to get over her ill humor,
and to ask him some questions. So he told
her his whole story,—how his mother was
blind and unable to work, and he was seeking
his fortune.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well,” said the old woman, “if that is
the case, I think you had better come and
live with me. I live in a little cottage not
far off, and am in want of a boy to go on
errands and do other little things for me.
If you will come and stay with me three
months, I will reward you as you deserve.
But I will warn you that I am very particular,
and shall require you to obey me in
every thing.”</p>

<p>Of course, Wide-awake was only too glad
to accept the old woman’s offer. He was
quite sure that he should be able to suit
her; and he could not help picturing to
himself how glad his mother would be to
have him return with perhaps a piece of
gold; for this seemed a great sum to Wide-awake,
and a very generous compensation
for three months’ labor.</p>

<p>After a while, they came to the old
woman’s cottage. It was a small house,
containing three rooms. One of these was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
a kitchen, in which the old woman did all
her cooking; another was her chamber; and
the third she told Wide-awake he should
have to sleep in.</p>

<p>Early the next morning, the old woman
came to his bedside, and shook him roughly.</p>

<p>“Up! up!” said she. “Is not the sun
up? and you are lying here asleep! What
is your name?”</p>

<p>“Wide-awake,” said he, rubbing his
eyes.</p>

<p>“Then,” said the old woman, “hereafter,
be sure to be wide awake before the sun.
Dress yourself as quickly as possible, and I
will give you your breakfast; and then to
work.”</p>

<p>Wide-awake was up and dressed in a
moment. The old woman set before him
a bowl of bread and milk for his breakfast.
After he had eaten this, she took him to a
fold near by, where he saw ten beautiful
sheep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>“These,” said she, “will be your care.
You will drive them to the great meadow a
mile hence, and watch them, taking care that
none stray away. Three times a day—at
morning, noon, and night—you will drive
them to the spring, and let them drink;
and, at seven o’clock, you may bring them
back.”</p>

<p>Wide-awake promised faithfully to obey
her in every respect. He found the great
meadow without difficulty. He watched
the sheep, and watered them, as he had
been directed, and, at nightfall, drove them
home. The old woman counted the sheep,
and, finding them all there, was well content,
and gave Wide-awake his supper.</p>

<p>So time passed on. Every day the old
woman became better satisfied with Wide-awake,
who, on his part, was looking
forward to the time when he might go
home.</p>

<p>One morning about this time, as Wide-awake<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
was about to drive out his sheep as
usual, the old woman stopped him.</p>

<p>“They have grown quite fat,” said she;
“so I shall carry them to the city and sell
them. I shall be gone a week, and shall
leave you here to take care of the house
while I am gone. You will not have much
to do. But there is one thing I must warn
you against: you must not, on any account,
open the door of the closet which is in your
chamber. If you do, you will repent it.”</p>

<p>Wide-awake was not troubled with curiosity;
and so he found no difficulty in
making this promise.</p>

<p>The old woman departed, and Wide-awake
was left alone. Having nothing else to do,
he began to think of home and his mother.
Then he began to wonder how much his
mistress meant to give him for his services.
He determined that he would buy a nice
arm-chair for his mother, and a great many
other things, if his money only held out.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
But they were all for his mother’s comfort,
and not for his own, as I have already explained
that Wide-awake was far from being
selfish.</p>

<p>On the fourth day after the old woman’s
departure, a stout man came to the door,
and asked leave to rest a little while. Wide-awake
knew that his mistress would have no
objection; so he gave him permission, and,
moreover, placed before him some bread
and milk. The man ate heartily, and, in
the mean time, contrived to draw out of
Wide-awake all the particulars of his situation,
and the old woman’s prohibiting him
to open the door of the closet.</p>

<p>“I have no doubt,” said he, “that it is
there where she keeps her money. If I
were in your place, I would look and see.
It wouldn’t do any harm.”</p>

<p>“But,” said Wide-awake, in astonishment,
“she told me not to do it on any account.”</p>

<p>“Never mind that,” said the man, winking:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
“it’ll do no harm; and she’ll never
know it.”</p>

<p>“But,” said Wide-awake, firmly, “I have
promised; and I never break my promise.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, if you won’t, I will,” said
the stranger, rising; “for I’m determined
to know what there is in that closet.”</p>

<p>But Wide-awake sprang to the door, set
his back resolutely against it, and said,—</p>

<p>“Never! while I live.”</p>

<p>“Poh!” was the contemptuous reply.
“What is your strength against mine?
Don’t you know that I can kill you?”</p>

<p>“That may be,” said Wide-awake, firmly,—though
the thoughts of his mother came
over his mind; and he could not help sighing
for her, if he should die,—“but I will
not yield.”</p>

<p>“Are you quite determined you will not
let me in?” said the stranger.</p>

<p>The voice seemed altered; and, looking
up, Wide-awake beheld, to his great surprise,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
that it was the old woman who addressed
him.</p>

<p>“Where is the man who was here a
minute since?” asked he in surprise.</p>

<p>The old woman smiled, and explained to
him that she was a fairy, and had taken a
man’s figure to test his sincerity. She said
she was quite satisfied with the result, and,
as she had no further need of his services,
would let him return home.</p>

<p>“But I owe you something for your past
fidelity. What shall it be? I leave it to
your choice. Wealth, happiness, and long
life: I will confer either of these upon you.
Choose.”</p>

<p>“And may I choose any thing I like?”
said Wide-awake, with eyes sparkling.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the fairy (for so we must now
call her).</p>

<p>“Then I will choose that my mother be
restored to sight.”</p>

<p>“You have chosen well, my child,” said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
the fairy, kindly: “it shall be as you say;
and, to reward you for your affection to your
mother, I will freely bestow upon you the
three gifts which you did not choose. You
shall be rich; and your life shall be both
long and happy.”</p>

<p>Wide-awake found his mother fully restored
to sight. With the wealth which the
fairy bestowed upon him, he built a neat
cottage for his mother, who was long spared
to him. The fairy’s promise was verified in
every particular.</p>

<h2 id="THE_ROYAL_CARPENTER_OF">THE ROYAL CARPENTER OF AMSTERDAM.</h2>

<p>The superintendent of the Dock Yard in
Amsterdam was seated in his office one
afternoon, indulging himself in smoking a
rude pipe; a luxury then recently imported
from the colony of Virginia, in the New
World.</p>

<p>His reflections, whatever they were, were
broken in upon by a knock at the door,—not
a timid, hesitating knock; but a bold,
authoritative summons. The superintendent,
judging it must proceed from some
person of consequence, hastily laid aside his
pipe, and quickly threw open the door, to
admit his unknown visitor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>Instead of the high personage he anticipated,
he beheld standing before him a stout
man, of commanding person, and dressed in
the attire of a workman.</p>

<p>He was a little vexed to think he had
been so much deceived; and perhaps it was
natural that he should accost the intruder
in a somewhat peevish manner.</p>

<p>“Well, my good man, what do you want,
that you come thumping at the door as if
you were really a man of mark? What
would you have?”</p>

<p>“I seek employment,” said the stranger
in a deep voice, not at all intimidated at his
reception.</p>

<p>At the same time, he presented a letter to
the superintendent.</p>

<p>“Ha!” said the latter, glancing at it with
considerable surprise; “from the Russian
ambassador!”</p>

<p>He read aloud as follows:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,—The bearer, a countryman of mine, is desirous
of obtaining employment in the Dock Yard under
your superintendence. He is not altogether unacquainted
with this description of labor, but wishes to perfect
himself in it. I feel assured that nowhere can he do so
to greater advantage than under your instruction.”</p>

</div>

<p>The compliment implied in the concluding
sentence served to moderate the vexation
occasioned by his recent misapprehension;
and he turned with a milder mien to his
visitor.</p>

<p>He was a little surprised to find, that,
quite unconscious of the great distance between
the superintendent of the Dock Yard
and a common workman, he had, without
ceremony, seated himself. “Humph!”
thought he; “I suppose that’s the way
they do in Russia.”</p>

<p>“So you are from Russia, my good man?”
said he, in a half-patronizing tone.</p>

<p>The visitor inclined his head in the affirmative.</p>

<p>“It’s a barbarous place, I’ve heard: the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
people are not half civilized; you did wisely
in coming here. You must see a great difference
between it and Holland?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the Russian, “we have
much to learn. Other nations are greatly
in advance of us in many respects; but
that will pass away, and Russia will take
her place at the head of them all.”</p>

<p>The superintendent shrugged his shoulders.
He evidently did not believe it.</p>

<p>“So you wish employment?” he continued,
after a pause. “What is your name?”</p>

<p>“Peter Timmerman,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“Very well; you may set to work to-morrow.
Your wages will be a florin a day.
You may report yourself at six o’clock.”</p>

<p>Thus terminated the interview. The
Russian made a bow of acknowledgment,
and left the office, leaving the superintendent
more puzzled than enlightened at the
insight into Russian character with which
he had been favored.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>The next morning, at the appointed time,
Peter Timmerman presented himself at the
Dock Yard. He set to work with an intelligence
and earnestness which evinced that
he was far from being a novice, and by no
means inclined to be a drone. A week had
not passed before he was acknowledged to
be the ablest workman in the yard.</p>

<p>His fellow-workmen looked upon him
with a little natural curiosity, and would
have been very glad of his confidence. It
was soon found, however, that, although
asking many questions in regard to the
details of his occupation, he preserved a
uniform silence respecting his own family
and past life, carefully evading any inquiries
which the curiosity of his companions
prompted. On one occasion, when some
one of them pushed it to an indiscreet extent,
the eyes of the Russian blazed with
anger, and he lifted the tool he had in his
hand in a threatening manner; but apparently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
reflection came to his aid, and, lowering
it, he proceeded with his work. This
little incident convinced his comrades, that,
whatever mystery there might be connected
with his past history, it would be both useless
and dangerous in them to endeavor to
extort it from him. Henceforth, then, he
was not troubled with inquiries, but was
treated with an involuntary and perhaps
unconscious deference by those with whom
he was brought in daily contact.</p>

<p>If occasionally it might be thought that
he was greater than he seemed, there was
nothing to confirm this idea in his mode of
life.</p>

<p>The florin which he daily earned was the
utmost limit of his expenses. No workman
lived more frugally. He had secured board
and lodgings at the house of a poor widow
woman, the mother of one of his companions
in the yard, where he paid a small
price, and lived accordingly. The whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
family consisted of the mother and son.
This son, who was a lively and well-looking
young man of one and twenty, was, next to
Peter, the most skilful workman in the yard.
He worked intelligently, and did not suffer
his eyes to remain idle. It was his ambition
to rise from the position of a mere workman,
and become a master-builder.</p>

<p>Perhaps one thing which contributed to
heighten his ambition was the fact that the
superintendent of the Dock Yard possessed,
among the items of his wealth, a fair,
cherry-cheeked damsel, whose beauty had
set half the hearts of the young men in
Amsterdam on fire. Trust me, friendly
reader! young men are pretty much alike
all the world over; and the current of
youthful feeling is just as likely to effervesce
in the Hollander, phlegmatic as he
is generally supposed, as in the residents of
more southern climes.</p>

<p>But, after all, was it not foolish in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
young ship-carpenter to aspire to an object
so generally admired and sought after as the
Fraulein superintendent? for such she was
designated, out of respect for her father’s
office. Perhaps it was; and yet Heinrich
Dort did not think so. After all, he was
the best judge in what concerned himself.</p>

<p>He had observed the young Fraulein’s
eyes wandering toward the side of the
church on which he sat, and he could not
mistake the object that attracted them.
Whenever the maiden saw that he was returning
her gaze, she always cast down her
eyes; and then, of course, she looked ten-fold
as beautiful in the eyes of Heinrich
Dort.</p>

<p>After all, the eye is more eloquent than
the tongue. Heinrich thought he could not
mistake it in this instance. It was certainly
rather singular that the two should meet in
the walk one pleasant Sabbath afternoon;
and no less so, perhaps, that, precisely at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
the moment, the Fraulein should drop a
brooch which she held in her hand. Of
course, she searched for it diligently in
every place but the right one; and, of
course, Heinrich was required, by the claims
of politeness, to volunteer his assistance.
The lost ornament was soon found; but
Heinrich, probably fearing it might be lost
again, did not leave the Fraulein, but accompanied
her, by a very round-about way,
to her home. Perhaps it might have been
absence of mind that made them miss the
direct way,—at least, so we will conjecture,
since we can do nothing more.</p>

<p>At all events, such was the commencement
of Heinrich’s acquaintance with the
Fraulein. They used to meet every Sabbath
afternoon; and Heinrich, acknowledging his
presumption all the time, ventured to confess
that his whole hope of happiness rested
upon her answer to a little question which
he had to propose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>What that question was, I may as well
leave to be surmised. The answer was conditionally
favorable. The maiden intimated
that no opposition need be anticipated from
her, provided he should obtain her father’s
consent. Heinrich felt very happy until he
began to consider that this qualification
might prove a very formidable one; and he
feared that the superintendent might think
the young workman altogether an inadequate
match for his daughter, whose dowry
would be twenty thousand florins at the very
least. But there is an old saying,—“Faint
heart never won fair lady.” Whether Heinrich
had ever heard of this, or whether, indeed,
it had ever been translated into Dutch
at all, I am quite unable to say; but, at all
events, he was resolved that such a prize
should not pass from his hands without a
struggle.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Although the young workman was far
from being constitutionally timid, preserving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
an undaunted front in the face of danger,
it must be confessed that his heart beat
audibly and his hand trembled perceptibly
as he knocked at the door of the superintendent’s
office; not that there was any
thing particularly suited to inspire fear in
the rotund figure of that personage.</p>

<p>The latter perceived that the young man
was disturbed. He was rather flattered to
find it so, as he attributed it solely to the
effect of his presence, which he privately
considered not a little imposing. It was,
therefore, with an approach to affability that
he motioned him to be seated, and inquired,—</p>

<p>“Well, my good fellow, how goes business?
Have you come for any instructions?”</p>

<p>“No, your excellency,” replied Heinrich.
“Business goes well enough; but it
is on another subject that I wish to trouble
you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, out with it, man. No parleying,—that’s
my way.”</p>

<p>“You have a daughter.”</p>

<p>“Donder and blitzen! So I always have
supposed. And is it to impart this precious
piece of information that you have come
here?”</p>

<p>“No, your excellency,” hesitated Heinrich;
“but the fact is, that—that—in
short, an attachment has sprung up between
your daughter and myself; and I am here to
crave your permission to marry her.”</p>

<p>“Well, that is coming to the point with a
vengeance!” exclaimed the testy little superintendent.
“And may I beg to know
whether my daughter sanctioned this visit
on your part?”</p>

<p>“She did.”</p>

<p>“Then she has less wit than I thought
for. She—the daughter of the superintendent
of the royal Dock Yard of Amsterdam—to
stoop to be the wife of a common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
workman! The girl must be out of her
senses. But if she chooses it to be so, I
shall not. Young man, you have been presumptuous.
For once, I will pass over it;
but beware of offending a second time.”</p>

<p>The little great man made an imperious
gesture of withdrawal, which Heinrich could
not do otherwise than obey. He returned
home in great depression, as might be anticipated
of one whose dearest hopes had been
crushed out. Sitting at the door, he perceived
his mother’s lodger and his own
fellow-workman, Peter Timmerman.</p>

<p>The latter, contrary to his custom, opened
a conversation with Heinrich, whose manner
he could not avoid noticing.</p>

<p>“What has befallen you, comrade,” he
said, “that you should look so woe-begone?”</p>

<p>“And if I tell you,” returned Heinrich,
whose disappointment had made him somewhat
testy,—“if I should tell you, how
could you help me?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>“Perhaps not at all,—perhaps very
much. At all events, it will relieve your
mind to unburden it of sorrow, if any
weighs upon it.”</p>

<p>“You may be right,” said Heinrich, after
a pause. “At all events, it will do no
harm. You must know, then, that I have
been foolish enough to fall in love with the
superintendent’s daughter, who favors my
suit. But because I am not wealthy, and
am <em>only a workman</em>” (the young man emphasized
the last words in a bitter tone),
“her father rejects my suit.”</p>

<p>“But how if you occupied as high a
position as himself?”</p>

<p>“Oh! then there would be nothing to
fear.”</p>

<p>“Listen, then, in your turn. I may help
you to what you seek. Did you ever hear
of Russia?”</p>

<p>“I have,” said Heinrich. “It is a great
country, but a barbarous one.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>“That is true; at least, it is not so far
advanced as its neighbors. But, if I live to
accomplish all my plans, it shall yet equal
any of them.”</p>

<p>“<em>You!</em> Who, then, are you?” exclaimed
the young man, in astonishment at such language
from such a source.</p>

<p>“<em>I am Peter, the reigning czar</em>,” said the
Russian, composedly. “I could trust no
one but myself to carry out a plan I had
formed for supplying the chief defect of
Russia,—an efficient navy. Accordingly,
I have entered myself here as a common
workman. I have gained what I sought;
I have made myself familiar with the construction
of vessels; and I shall, after a
brief visit to England, return to my kingdom,
and take measures to build a fleet. I
have thought of you as one competent to
superintend their building. You shall have
a handsome salary, and I will confer upon
you an order of nobility.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then I can marry the Fraulein superintendent
after all!” And Heinrich leaped
to his feet in exultation. “But how shall I
thank your ex⸺ I mean your majesty,
for such a load of favors?”</p>

<p>“By fidelity to my interests,” said Peter.
“But I am tired, and must go in. Whatever
arrangements you make must be completed
within three days. Good night.”</p>

<p>The next morning, Heinrich paid another
visit to the superintendent. When he left,
at the end of half an hour, the superintendent
accompanied him to the door in the
excess of his affability. No more opposition
was made to his suit. Heinrich Dort,
the workman, was quite a different person
from Heinrich Dort, general superintendent
of the Russian navy.</p>

<p>The events which followed are known to
history. Peter, with the assistance of his
superintendent, laid the foundation of a
flourishing marine; and the latter, through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
all the mutations of the Russian dynasty,
succeeded in retaining the confidence of the
government until Death gathered him to his
fathers at a ripe old age.</p>

<h2 id="THE_VEILED_MIRROR">THE VEILED MIRROR.</h2>

<p>The old year was fast drawing to a close.
But a few hours, and the advent of its successor
would be hailed by merry shouts and
joyful gratulations, mingling with the merry
chime of bells ringing out a noisy welcome
from church-towers and steeples.</p>

<p>Adam Hathaway, a wealthy merchant, sat
in his counting-room, striking a balance between
his gains and losses for the year
which had nearly passed. From the smile
that lighted up his countenance, as he drew
near the end of his task, it might safely be
inferred that the result proved satisfactory.</p>

<p>He at length threw down his pen, after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
footing up the last column, and exclaimed
joyfully,—</p>

<p>“Five thousand dollars net gain in one
year! That will do very well,—very well
indeed. If I am as well prospered in the
year to come, it will indeed be a ‘happy
New Year.’”</p>

<p>His meditations were interrupted by a
knock at the door. He opened it, and saw
standing before him a man of ordinary appearance,
bearing under his arm something,
the nature of which he could not conjecture,
wrapped up in brown paper.</p>

<p>“Mr. Hathaway, I believe?” was the
stranger’s salutation.</p>

<p>“You are correct.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps, if not particularly engaged,
you will allow me a few minutes’ conversation
with you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, certainly,” was the surprised reply;
“though I am at a loss to conjecture
what can have brought you here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>“You are a wealthy man, Mr. Hathaway,
and every year increases your possessions.
May I ask what is your object in accumulating
so much property?”</p>

<p>“This is a very singular question, sir,”
said the merchant, who began to entertain
doubts as to his visitor’s sanity,—“very
singular. I suppose I am influenced by the
same motives that actuate other men,—the
necessity of providing for my physical
wants, and so contributing to my happiness.”</p>

<p>“And this contents you? But your gains
are not all devoted to this purpose. This
last year, for example, the overplus has
amounted to five thousand dollars.”</p>

<p>“I know not where you have gained
your information,” said Mr. Hathaway, in
surprise. “However, you are right.”</p>

<p>“And what do you intend to do with
this?”</p>

<p>“You are somewhat free with your questions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
sir. However, I have no objection to
answering you. I shall lay it up.”</p>

<p>“For what purpose? I need not tell
you that money, in itself, is of no value. It
is only the representative of value. Why,
then, do you allow it to remain idle?”</p>

<p>“How else should I employ it? I have
a comfortable house well furnished: should
I purchase one more expensive? My table
is well provided: should I live more luxuriously?
My wardrobe is well supplied:
should I dress more expensively?”</p>

<p>“To these questions I answer, No. But
it does not follow, because you have a good
house, comfortable clothing, and a well-supplied
table, that others are equally well
provided. Have you thought to give of
your abundance to those who are needy,—to
promote your own happiness by advancing
that of others?”</p>

<p>“I must confess that this is a duty which
I have neglected. But there are alms-houses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
and benevolent societies. There cannot be
much misery that escapes their notice,” said
Mr. Hathaway.</p>

<p>“You shall judge for yourself.”</p>

<p>The stranger commenced unwrapping the
package which he carried under his arm. It
was a small mirror, with a veil hanging before
it. He slowly withdrew the veil, and
said, “Look!”</p>

<p>A change passed over the surface of the
mirror. Mr. Hathaway, as he looked at it
intently, found that it reflected a small room,
scantily furnished; while a fire flickered in
the grate. A bed stood in one corner of the
room, on which reposed a sick man. By
the side of it sat a woman, with a thin shawl
over her shoulders, busily plying her needle.
An infant boy lay in a cradle not far off,
which a little girl called Alice, whose wasted
form and features spoke of want and privation,
was rocking to sleep.</p>

<p>“Would you hear what they are saying?”
asked the stranger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>The merchant nodded acquiescence. Immediately
there came to his ear the confused
noise of voices, from which he soon distinguished
that of the sick man, who asked for
some food.</p>

<p>“We have none in the house,” said his
wife. “But I shall soon get this work
finished; and then I shall be able to get
some.”</p>

<p>The husband groaned: “Oh that I should
be obliged to remain idle on a sick bed,
when I might be earning money for you
and the children! The doctor says, that,
now the fever has gone, I need nothing but
nourishing food to raise me up again. But,
alas! I see no means of procuring it. Would
that some rich man, out of his abundance,
would supply me with but a trifle from his
board! To him it would be nothing; to
me, every thing.”</p>

<p>The scene vanished; and gradually another
formed itself upon the surface of the
mirror.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a small room, neatly but not expensively
furnished. There were two occupants,—a
man of middle age, and a youth
of a bright, intellectual countenance, which
at present seemed overspread with an air of
dejection.</p>

<p>Mr. Hathaway, to his surprise, recognized
in the gentleman Mark Audley, a fellow-merchant
and formerly intimate friend, who,
but a few months before, had failed in business,
and, too honorable to defraud his
creditors, had given up all his property.
Since his failure, he had been reduced to
accept a clerkship.</p>

<p>“I am sorry, Arthur,” said he to his son,
“very sorry, that I could not carry out
my intention of entering you at college. I
know your tastes have always led you to
think of a professional career; but my sudden
change of circumstances has placed it
out of my power to gratify you. It is best
for you to accept the situation which has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
been offered you, and enter Mr. Bellamy’s
store. It is a very fair situation, and will
suit you as well as any.”</p>

<p>“I believe you are right, sir,” said Arthur,
respectfully; “though it will be hard to
resign the hopes that I have so long cherished.
I met Henry Fulham to-day. He
was in my class at school, and is to enter
college next fall. I couldn’t help envying
him. How soon will Mr. Bellamy wish me
to enter his store?”</p>

<p>“Day after to-morrow, I believe,—that
is, with the beginning of the year; New
Year’s Day being considered a holiday.”</p>

<p>“Very well; you may tell him that I will
come at that time.”</p>

<p>The scene vanished as before. A change
passed over the surface of the mirror. Again
the merchant looked, and, to his surprise,
beheld the interior of his own store. A
faint light was burning, by the light of
which a young man, whom he recognized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
as Frank Durell, one of his own clerks,
was reading a letter, the contents of which
seemed to agitate him powerfully.</p>

<p>The scene was brought so near, that he
could, without difficulty, trace the lines,
written in a delicate, female hand, as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">My dear Son</span>,—You are not, probably, expecting
to hear from me at this time. Alas that I should have
such an occasion to write! At the time of your father’s
death, it was supposed, that, by the sacrifice of every
thing, we had succeeded in liquidating all his debts.
Even this consolation is now denied us. I received a
call from Mr. Perry this morning, who presented for
<em>immediate payment</em> a note given by your father for fifty
dollars. Immediate payment! How, with a salary barely
sufficient to support us, can you meet such a charge? Can
any way be devised? Mr. Perry threatens, if the money
is not forthcoming, to seize our furniture. He is a hard
man, and I have no hopes of appeasing him. I do not
know that you can do any thing to retard it; but I have
thought it right to acquaint you with this new calamity.</p>

<p class="center">“Your affectionate mother,</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Mary Durell.</span>”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>The young man laid down the letter with
an air of depression.</p>

<p>“I scarcely know how to provide for this
new contingency,” said he, meditatively.
“My salary is small; and it requires the
strictest economy to meet my expenses. I
might ask for an advance; but Mr. Hathaway
is particular on that point, and I should
but court a refusal. But to have my mother’s
furniture taken from the house! The
whole amount would hardly cover the debt.
There is one resource; but alas that I should
ever think of resorting to it! I could take
the money from the till, and return it when
I am able. But shall I ever be able? It
would be no more nor less than robbery.
At all events, I will not do it to-night. Who
knows but something may turn up to help
us?”</p>

<p>The young man blew out the lamp, and
left the store. The picture faded.</p>

<p>“I will show you another picture, somewhat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
different from the others: it will be
the last,” said the stranger.</p>

<p>The next scene represented the interior
of a baker’s shop. The baker—a coarse-featured
man, with a hard, unprepossessing
aspect—was waiting on a woman thinly
clad in garments more suitable for June than
December. She was purchasing two loaves
of bread and a few crackers. There was
another customer waiting his turn. It was
a gentleman, with a pleasant smile on his
face.</p>

<p>“Make haste!” said the baker, rudely,
to the woman, who was searching for her
money to pay for her purchases. “I can’t
stop all day; and here’s a gentleman that
you keep waiting.”</p>

<p>“Oh! never mind me: I am in no hurry,”
the gentleman said.</p>

<p>“I am afraid,” said the woman, in an
alarmed tone, “that I have lost my money.
I had it here in my pocket; but it is gone.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then you may return the bread. I
don’t sell for nothing.”</p>

<p>“Trust me for once, sir; I will pay you
in a day or two; otherwise my children
must go without food to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Can’t help that. You shouldn’t have
been so careless.”</p>

<p>The woman was about turning away, when
the voice of the other customer arrested her
steps.</p>

<p>“How much money have you lost?” he
inquired.</p>

<p>“It was but half a dollar,” was the reply;
“but it was of consequence to me, as I can
get no more for a day or two; and how we
are to live till then, Heaven knows.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps that will help you to decide
the question.” And he took from his pocket
a five-dollar bill, and handed it to her.</p>

<p>“Oh, sir!” said she, her face lighting up
with gratitude, “this is indeed generous
and noble. The blessings of those you have
befriended attend you!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>She remained to make a few purchases,
and then, with a light heart, departed.</p>

<p>The last picture faded from the mirror;
and the stranger, wrapping it up, simply
said,—</p>

<p>“You have seen how much happiness a
trifling sum can produce. Will you not,
out of your abundance, make a similar experiment?”</p>

<p>The stranger disappeared; and Mr. Hathaway
awoke to find his dream terminated by
the chime of the New Year’s bells.</p>

<p>“This is something more than a dream,”
said he, thoughtfully. “I will, at all events,
take counsel of the mystic vision; and it
shall not be my fault if some hearts are not
made happier through my means before another
sun sets.”</p>

<p>When the merchant arose on the following
morning, it was with the light heart
which always accompanies the determination
to do right. He was determined that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
the salutation of “A happy New Year”
should not be with him a mere matter of
lip-service.</p>

<p>“I believe,” said he to himself, “I will
go and see my old friend, Mark Audley. If
his son Arthur is really desirous of going to
college, what is there to prevent my bearing
the expenses? I am abundantly able, and
can dispose of my money in no better way.”</p>

<p>As he walked along with this praiseworthy
determination in his heart, his attention
was drawn towards a little girl, who was
gazing, with eager, wistful eyes, into the
window of a neighboring shop, where were
displayed, in tempting array, some fine
oranges. He thought—nay, he was quite
sure—that in her he recognized the little
girl who figured in the first scene unfolded
the evening before by the mysterious mirror.
By way of ascertaining, he addressed her in
pleasant tone:—</p>

<p>“Your name is Alice,—is it not?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” said she, looking up, surprised,
and somewhat awed.</p>

<p>“And your father is sick,—is he not?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; but he is almost well now.”</p>

<p>“I saw you were looking at the oranges
in that window. Now, I will buy you a
dozen, if you will let me help you carry
them home.”</p>

<p>The purchase was made; and the merchant
walked along, conversing with his
little conductor, who soon lost her timidity.</p>

<p>Arrived at the little girl’s home, he found
that he had not been deceived in his presentiments.
It was the same room that he
had seen pictured in the mirror. The sick
man was tossing uneasily in bed when Alice
entered.</p>

<p>“See, papa,” said she, joyfully,—“see
what nice oranges I have for you! And
here is the kind gentleman who gave them
to me.”</p>

<p>The merchant, before he left the humble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
apartment, gave its occupants a timely donation,
and made New Year’s Day a day of
thanksgiving.</p>

<p>Mr. Hathaway soon found himself at the
residence of his friend Audley, who gave
him a warm welcome. “This is indeed
kind,” said he. “The friendship that adversity
cannot interrupt is really valuable.”</p>

<p>Mr. Hathaway now introduced the object
of his visit, asking, “What do you mean to
do with Arthur? He was nearly ready to
go to college,—was he not?”</p>

<p>“He was; and this is one of the severest
trials attending my reversed circumstances,
that I am compelled to disappoint his long-cherished
wish of obtaining a college education.”</p>

<p>“That must not be,” said Mr. Hathaway.
“If you and Arthur will consent, I will
myself pay his charges through college.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Hathaway,” said Mr. Audley, in a
glow of surprise and pleasure, “this offer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
evinces a noble generosity on your part that
I shall never forget. You must let me tell
Arthur the good news.”</p>

<p>Mr. Audley summoned his son, and,
pointing to Mr. Hathaway, said, “This
gentleman has offered to send you to college
at his own expense.”</p>

<p>The eyes of the youth lighted up; and
he grasped the hand of his benefactor, saying,
simply, “Oh! if you but knew how
happy you have made me!”</p>

<p>“I do not deserve your thanks,” was the
smiling reply. “I have learned that to
make others happy is the most direct way
to secure my own happiness.”</p>

<p>Mr. Hathaway took his way to the store.
Arrived there, he sought out Frank Durell,
and requested him to step into his office, as
he wished to speak to him in private.</p>

<p>“Your salary is five hundred dollars a
year, I believe?” said he.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” said Frank Durell, somewhat
surprised.</p>

<p>“I have come to the conclusion that this
is insufficient, and I shall therefore advance
it two hundred dollars; and, as a part of it
may not be unacceptable to you now, here
are a hundred dollars that you may consider
an advance.”</p>

<p>“Sir,” said Frank Durell, hardly believing
his senses, “you cannot estimate the benefit
I shall derive from this generosity. My
mother, who depends upon me for support,
was about to be deprived of her furniture
by an extortionate creditor; but this timely
gift—for I must consider it so—will remove
this terrible necessity. I thank you,
sir, from my heart.”</p>

<p>“You are quite welcome,” said the merchant,
kindly. “In future, consider me
your friend; and, if you should at any
time be in want of advice or assistance, do
not scruple to confide in me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>“At least,” said the merchant, thoughtfully,
“I have done something to make this
a ‘happy New Year’ for others. The lesson
conveyed in the dream of last night shall
not be thrown away upon me. I will take
care that many hearts shall have cause to
bless the vision of <span class="smcap">The Veiled Mirror</span>.”</p>

<h2 id="THE_PRIZE_PAINTING">THE PRIZE PAINTING.</h2>

<h3>I.</h3>

<p>It was a small attic chamber in an obscure
part of London. The light that entered at
the open window revealed two figures,—Arthur
Elliott and his young wife.</p>

<p>“Dear Arthur,” said the latter, as she
brushed back the heavy chestnut locks from
his pale brow, “you must not—indeed
you must not—labor so incessantly. You
will injure your health,—perhaps ruin it
entirely,—and then what will be left to
me?”</p>

<p>“Mary,” said the young painter, caressingly,
“you are alarming yourself to no
purpose. I am not weary. Besides, what
were a little weariness in comparison with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
the great purpose I have in view? You
know the exhibition will open in a fortnight;
and my picture is still unfinished. Oh!”
continued he, with enthusiasm, while a faint
flush overspread his pale cheek, “if it could
be my fortune to gain the great prize of five
hundred pounds which has been offered for
the best painting on exhibition, I believe I
could die content!”</p>

<p>“Arthur!” said his wife, reproachfully.</p>

<p>“But better still,” said the young painter,
caressingly, “to live and enjoy it with you,
my sweet wife! With such a start, what
might I not hope for? Fame, fortune,
friends, all would be mine. But it is growing
late; and I have still much to do before
I retire. But do not wait for me, dear
Mary: I shall work the faster, if I know
that you are reposing.”</p>

<p>Arthur Elliott was the son of a clergyman
in one of the midland counties of
England. At the age of seventeen, he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
entered the office of his uncle, an attorney
in London,—a hard, worldly man, wholly
engrossed in business. Young Arthur, who
was a boy of a sensitive and highly imaginative
temperament, found little sympathy
with his peculiar tastes in the musty folios
over which he was expected to pore day
after day, or in the deeds and legal instruments
which he was called upon to engross.
He devoted his leisure time to obtaining
some knowledge of painting from a teacher
of that art. He made so great proficiency
in this department as to surprise his teacher,
who exclaimed, with enthusiasm, that he
was born to be an artist.</p>

<p>“And why should I not be?” thought
Arthur to himself. “With law I am completely
disgusted: I shall never make a
figure at it. Why, then, should I not abandon
what I so utterly detest, and pursue
that which offers so much stronger attraction?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>Full of this resolution, he went to his
uncle, and requested his permission to adopt
it. But the scheme appeared absurd and
chimerical to the man of business; and he
utterly forbade Arthur’s cherishing any
such plans in future. This, to one of his
nephew’s high spirit, was more than he
could bear. His place in his uncle’s office
was vacant the next day, and remained so.
Arthur had collected his little articles of
personal property, and fled to the house
of his instructor, where, undetected, he pursued
his studies with the utmost assiduity.
His master had a daughter, a beautiful girl,
whose disposition and manners were as
amiable as her features were faultless.
What wonder that Arthur fell in love, and
that the two, with her father’s consent,
exchanged vows of fidelity, though both
were as yet too young to think of marriage?</p>

<p>This, however, was hastened by an event<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
which plunged them both in affliction.
Mary’s father died. She was left alone in
the world, with no one but Arthur to depend
upon. Arthur was just on the verge
of twenty; Mary, but sixteen. Under the
circumstances, however, it was thought best
that they should marry. Mary’s fortune was
but small, her father having left nothing
behind him but the materials of his art.</p>

<p>At first, Arthur resolved to follow in the
steps of his father-in-law, but, as is too
often the case, found that genius unknown
is unappreciated. His income became very
scanty,—hardly sufficient to supply himself
and Mary with the bare necessaries of life.</p>

<p>It was at this stage in their fortunes that
it was announced, that, at the annual exhibition
of paintings, the prize already alluded
to would be awarded to the most meritorious
production of art. This offer fired Arthur’s
ambition. Why should not he, filled as he
was with the inspiration of genius,—why<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
should not he gain it? It was not impossible.
He would at least try.</p>

<p>He selected as his subject “The Transfiguration
of the Saviour.” Without entering
into the details of the painting, which
could only be done properly by an artist, it
is sufficient to say that the conception was a
grand one, and the execution of a high
character.</p>

<p>But, in the mean time, how were they to
live? The painting on which Arthur was
now engaged was a work of time; and it
was a considerable period before he could
hope to derive any pecuniary profit from it.
Thus far, Mary had assisted her husband, as
far as she was able, by obtaining work from
the slop-shops, which amounted to a mere
pittance. But they had learned to live frugally
under that sternest of teachers,—Necessity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p>It was early in the morning of the day
after that on which our story commences.
Arthur, worn out by his midnight vigils,
had not yet risen. Mary was astir: she had
already prepared and eaten a frugal meal;
and the small table—the only one in the
apartment—was covered with a white cloth,
on which was spread, with as tempting an
array as the nature of the food would admit,
the breakfast intended for her husband.</p>

<p>Suddenly, there was a violent knock at
the door. Mary glanced towards her husband,—who
was still buried in deep sleep,—apprehensive
that he might be awakened,
and then went to the door and opened it.</p>

<p>A coarse-featured man entered.</p>

<p>“Good morning, Mrs. Elliott,” was his
salutation. “You see I have come for my
week’s rent. I am not likely to forget
that.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>“The rent!” said Mary, apprehensively.
“I am sorry, Mr. Mudge; but I haven’t
quite got it ready. I didn’t succeed in
finishing the work I had on hand as soon
as I anticipated; and I must ask your indulgence
for a day or two.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! the old story!” said the man,
with a sneer. “And if I should come again
in a day or two, you wouldn’t have finished
the work you have on hand, and would ask
for a day or two more. Oh, yes! I am used
to such games.”</p>

<p>“But, Mr. Mudge, have I failed you before?
and should I be likely to begin now?
If you will come on Tuesday, you shall have
the money, if I have to pawn some of my
furniture to raise it.”</p>

<p>Mr. Mudge was half persuaded, but still
sullen. “There’s your husband,—why
doesn’t he work? He is able to. You
wouldn’t find any difficulty in raising the
rent, if he would do something.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>“Arthur works already beyond his
strength,” was the wife’s slightly indignant
rejoinder (for she could not bear to
have any imputation cast upon <em>him</em>); “and
some day we shall see what will come of
it.”</p>

<p>Just then, her husband stirred in his
sleep; and Mary, hastily repeating, “Call
again on Tuesday, and you shall have it,”
closed the door, and went to his bedside.</p>

<p>“They are a proud set,” said Mudge to
himself, as he descended the rickety staircase,
which nearly caused him to stumble,—“they
are a proud set; and they say
pride and poverty always go together. But,
if the rent isn’t ready on Tuesday, their
pride will be likely to meet with a fall, or
my name isn’t Mudge.”</p>

<p>Perceiving that her husband still slept,
the artist’s wife took up her work, and
began to ply her needle busily. The work
she had received from the slop-shop consisted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
of shirts, for which she received
ninepence apiece. She had taken a bundle
of six, which, when completed, would
amount to a little less than a crown. By
great diligence, she could make three of
these in two days; which would give them
an income of not quite seven shillings per
week. Of this sum, one half was obliged
to go for the rent of the miserable room in
which they lodged.</p>

<p>By and by, Arthur awoke from the deep
sleep in which he had been plunged, and
looked around him.</p>

<p>“It is late,” said he: “the sun is already
high; and I must to work.”</p>

<p>He dressed himself hastily, and partook
of the food which his wife had prepared for
him.</p>

<p>The next day passed; and Monday afternoon
brought to Mrs. Elliott the sad conviction
that she had miscalculated as to the
rapidity with which she could perform her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
work, and that she would not, after all, be
prepared to meet Mr. Mudge with the rent
on the day following. Knowing his unfeeling
nature, she could not doubt that he
would insist on their instantly vacating the
apartment. This was to be avoided at all
hazards. She knew her husband’s high
spirit; and she feared for the consequences,
if Mr. Mudge should be insolent.</p>

<p>Full of this thought, she took a light gold
chain, which in happier days her husband
had presented to her, and proceeded, with
reluctant step, to the pawnbroker’s. It was
drawing towards evening; and she hurried
through the streets, scarcely daring to look
to the right hand or to the left, lest she
might meet with some interruption.</p>

<p>Solomon Fagin, a Jew, who fully sustained
the reputation of his race, as an
avaricious man wholly devoted to the love
of gain, stood, with a cringing expression
on his drawn-up features, behind the counter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
of his shop in David’s Alley. He was
trafficking, or rather seemed to have just
closed a sale, with a young gentleman well
dressed and of prepossessing appearance.
The latter made way politely for Mary, who
was too much pre-occupied to acknowledge
his courtesy.</p>

<p>“How much will you advance me on
this?” asked she, hurriedly, extending the
chain, which had originally been purchased
for two guineas.</p>

<p>Solomon looked in her face cunningly, as
if to estimate, by the degree of anxiety she
displayed, how little he might venture to
offer.</p>

<p>Mary was very nervous, and exceedingly
anxious to get home before it grew much
darker. This probably gave her an appearance
of solicitude, which the Jew attributed
to destitution.</p>

<p>“These things ish very sheap,” he at
length said,—“dog-sheap: people don’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
want ’em. I can’t offer you more than ten
shillings, and shall lose on that.”</p>

<p>The young gentleman had been an attentive
spectator of this scene. He fathomed
the cunning of the Jew, and, advancing to
the counter, took the chain in his hands.</p>

<p>“Come, Solomon, this is too bad! You
should offer three times as much, and you
would make a good bargain then. You
know, as well as I do, that that chain never
cost less than two guineas. Come, come! be
honest for once.”</p>

<p>“It ish all very well,” said Solomon, who
did not relish the interruption, “vor young
shentleman to talk; but if young shentleman
should keep a pawnbroker’s shop, he
would change his mind.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps so; but I will wait till I am a
pawnbroker first. But, Solomon, if you
don’t offer more, I’ll take it myself.”</p>

<p>The Jew, who was afraid of losing a good
bargain, and internally cursing the interference<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
of the young gentleman, began to
mumble that it was very hard to press a
poor man so,—that he should certainly
lose on it. However, he closed by offering
fifteen shillings.</p>

<p>Mrs. Elliott was about to close with this
offer; but the other stepped forward, and
said,—</p>

<p>“No, no! this will never do. That chain
cost two guineas at least. I am sure of it;
for I bought one precisely similar the other
day. Give it to me, madam,” said he, respectfully,
to Mrs. Elliott, “and I will
advance you that sum.”</p>

<p>The artist’s wife accepted his proffer with
grateful astonishment, and hastened to leave
the shop. She had gone but a few steps,
when she was overtaken by the chance
companion whom she had met at the pawnbroker’s.</p>

<p>“Do not think me bold,” said he, “if I
suggest that it is hardly safe to carry money<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
open in your hand; and, indeed, it is so
dark, that it is hardly safe at all for a lady
to pass through the streets unattended. If
you will accept my escort, I shall be most
happy to conduct you to your lodgings.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Elliott hesitated. She knew it was
scarcely safe to trust to an entire stranger;
but the young man’s conduct thus far had
so prepossessed her in his favor, that she
did not refuse.</p>

<p>“Sir,” she replied, after a moment’s hesitation,
“I know not whether I am in the
right; but I cannot help trusting you. I
do not think you intend to impose upon me.
I <em>will</em> trust to you.”</p>

<p>“You shall not regret your confidence,”
said her companion. “May I ask where
you reside?”</p>

<p>“At 16, S⸺ Street,” was the reply of
Mrs. Elliott. “I am much indebted to you,
sir, no less for the trouble you are now
taking than for the generosity with which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
you saved me from being imposed upon by
the Jew.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said the other, laughing, “Solomon
is a cunning old fellow, who will cheat
where he gets a chance. No worse Jew for
that, or pawnbroker either. It is their business
to cheat; and I fancy Fagin is as much
of an adept at it as any one.</p>

<p>“I hope,” he continued, after a pause,
“that you were not driven by distress to
the sale of an article which you must value
highly?”</p>

<p>“It was presented to me by my husband,”
was the reply. “I would not have parted
with it, but that this was probably the
only means of saving ourselves from being
turned out of doors.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry for that,” was the sympathizing
reply. “Does your husband know
that you have come out on such an errand?”</p>

<p>“No, or he would have offered to pawn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
some of his own clothing first. Of this I
was afraid; and it was for this reason that
I stole secretly out.”</p>

<p>They had now reached the outer door of
the dwelling in the upper part of which
Mr. Elliott lodged. It was necessary for
them to part.</p>

<p>In parting, the stranger pressed Mrs. Elliott’s
hand, and then walked rapidly away.
She found, to her astonishment, that he had
placed the chain in her hand. But he was
now so far distant that she could not call
him back. Thanking him in her heart for
this unlooked-for generosity, Mrs. Elliott
went up stairs with a light heart; for she
foresaw, that, with the sum of money of
which she had so providentially come into
possession, they would be able to live comfortably
for some weeks; in addition to which,
she would have it in her power to procure
some delicacies for her husband’s palate.</p>

<p>After a little consideration, she decided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
not to mention this adventure to her husband;
as the idea of her selling his gift
would be painful to him, and would do him
no good. There was no danger of his inquiring,
so much was he absorbed in his
painting. Besides, if he thought at all upon
the subject, he would think she had been out
on business connected with her work.</p>

<p>She hastily passed up stairs, and set about
preparing supper for herself and husband.</p>

<h3>III.</h3>

<p>The sun was not more punctual to his
hour of rising than was the visit of Mr.
Mudge, the landlord, to the lodging of the
artist.</p>

<p>“Well,” said he, abruptly, “have you
got the rent ready? I can’t wait a day
longer.”</p>

<p>“Nor will it be necessary,” said Mrs.
Elliott, calmly. “Here is the money.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Mudge, notwithstanding his love of
money, looked a little disappointed at this
ready payment. His mind was essentially
a vulgar one; and he felt an instinctive aversion
to Mrs. Elliott, whose superiority to
himself he could not help admitting. He
had hoped to have the pleasure of turning
them out.</p>

<p>“Well, they won’t always have ready
money,” was his internal reflection; “and,
the first good excuse I have, they shall go,
bag and baggage.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Mr. Elliott was making progress
on his painting.</p>

<p>“You deserve the prize, Arthur,” said
his wife, after gazing admiringly upon her
husband’s work,—“you deserve it; and I
hope that you will be successful in obtaining
it.”</p>

<p>“It has cost me many hours of hard
labor,” said the artist, wearily, as he laid
aside his pallet for a moment, and passed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
his hand across his brow. “I never felt so
great an interest in a picture before; and
now two days’ labor, I think, will complete
it. It needs but a few touches.”</p>

<p>As he spoke, Mary saw an unnatural
flush upon his cheek, and that his eye
glowed with an unusual brilliancy. She
was alarmed.</p>

<p>“Do, Arthur, for my sake, lie down and
rest a while. You do not look well, and
sleep will refresh you. You say two days
will finish it, and you have a week before
you.”</p>

<p>“I believe I will lie down for a few
minutes,” said Arthur; “for my head aches
strangely, and I feel weary.”</p>

<p>He laid down; but it did not refresh him.
In a little while, he became feverish, so that
he could not leave his bed. His wife went
out to summon a physician. All her hopes
centred in Arthur; and the thought that
he was sick, that he was in danger, quickened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
her step. She saw nothing that was
going on around her, so intent was she on
her object, till suddenly some one touched
her familiarly on the shoulder. She looked
around, and saw by her side the companion
whom she had encountered at the pawnbroker’s.</p>

<p>“I am happy to meet you once more,”
said he; “but you seem in haste.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said she, hurriedly; “my husband
has been suddenly taken sick, and I am
in pursuit of a physician.”</p>

<p>“Let me relieve you of that duty. If
you will return to your husband, who doubtless
needs your presence, I will summon a
physician. I know your lodgings, and will
return with medical assistance immediately.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Elliott gratefully accepted this proffer
of service, for she had felt much solicitude.
When she returned, she found her
husband seized with a fit of delirium, in
which he uttered incoherent sentences, all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
of which had some connection with his picture
and the approaching exhibition.</p>

<p>In a few minutes, the stranger returned
with a physician. To the anxious inquiries
of Mrs. Elliott, the doctor replied,—</p>

<p>“Your husband is suffering from the excitement
and fatigue consequent upon too
severe mental exertion. This has thrown
him into a fever, from which it will take
time to recover.”</p>

<p>After leaving directions, he withdrew,
promising to repeat his visit the next day.</p>

<p>“How much my poor husband will be
disappointed!” Mrs. Elliott could not help
exclaiming. “He must now abandon the
hope of presenting his picture at the exhibition.”</p>

<p>“What!” said her visitor, with interest,
“is your husband an artist?”</p>

<p>In reply, Mrs. Elliott led him to a corner
of the room, and withdrew the screen that
concealed the painting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>He gazed upon it with deep admiration
for some minutes, and then said, with enthusiasm,—</p>

<p>“Ah! this is indeed beautiful!”</p>

<p>“It is nearly completed,” said the artist’s
wife; “but that will be of no service to us
now.” And she let fall the screen, and
sighed heavily.</p>

<p>A sudden idea struck the visitor.</p>

<p>“Will you trust the painting to me for a
few days?” he asked. “You shall not
regret it.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Elliott, convinced that her husband
would not recover in time to finish it,
assented without difficulty. She never
thought of distrusting one who had been
of such essential service.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said the visitor. “As
you have reposed this confidence in me, I
must acquaint you with my name and address,
that you may know whom you have
trusted.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>He handed her a card containing the
following direction: “F. Sedley, 7, Covent
Place.”</p>

<p>“I will send for it this afternoon,” said
he, as he withdrew, “and will call in upon
you again to-day or to-morrow. I shall be
anxious to learn how your husband gets
on.”</p>

<p>The delirium which attended the early
stages of Mr. Elliott’s indisposition continued
for some days. At length, consciousness
returned.</p>

<p>“How long have I been sick?” he inquired.</p>

<p>He was told.</p>

<p>“And what day is it now?”</p>

<p>“Wednesday, the fourteenth.”</p>

<p>“And to-morrow the exhibition will take
place. Oh that I could have held out but
two days longer! I would have asked for
no more. In that time I should have completed
my painting, and it would have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
entered in competition. Fate seems to be
against me.”</p>

<p>He groaned, and covered his face with his
hands.</p>

<p>“But,” said his wife, soothingly, “remember,
dear Arthur, that, if Fate seems
against us, God is always with us. He
orders every thing in infinite wisdom.”</p>

<p>“But,” was the hardly reconciled answer,
“his ways are very difficult of comprehension.
The wisdom is hidden. I cannot
see it.”</p>

<p>“Yet,” said his wife, full of hopeful confidence,
“if we trust in him, we shall not be
deceived.”</p>

<p>“But,” said Arthur, after a pause, “how
shall we live in the mean time? I can do
nothing now for our support; and much of
your time is taken up in attendance upon
me.”</p>

<p>“I am richer than you think,” said Mary,
opening her purse, and displaying the sum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
she had received from her visitor, much of
which was still untouched.</p>

<p>To his inquiries how she obtained it, she
replied by unfolding the whole story, and
indulged in the warmest encomiums on the
generosity and kindness of Mr. Sedley, whose
providential interposition had saved her
from being imposed upon by the avaricious
pawnbroker. Arthur was interested in the
recital, and expressed a wish to become
acquainted with him. After a pause, he
inquired for the painting. “Let me look
upon it once more,” said he. “Perhaps I
shall be better able to judge of its merits
after a lapse of time.”</p>

<p>Mary looked embarrassed. “Excuse me,”
said she to her husband; “but Mr. Sedley
expressed a wish to carry it home with him
for a few days, and I could not refuse.
Doubtless he wished to exhibit it to some
of his friends; and in that way it may find a
purchaser.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>Arthur acquiesced in this conclusion,
and approved of the course which Mary
had adopted.</p>

<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>It was the morning of the exhibition,—a
clear, bright morning in September, which
seemed to combine all the balmy softness of
summer with a freedom from its excessive
heat. The sun shone down upon the numberless
roofs of the great city, and found its
way into the lanes and alleys, lighting them
up, for the hour, with a brightness not their
own. Through the little window—the
only one—by which light was admitted
into the room where the Elliotts lodged, the
golden rays streamed in, and lent their glory
to the face of the sleeping artist, who had
not yet awakened from the night’s slumber.</p>

<p>There was a knock at the door. Mary
opened it; and Mr. Sedley made his appearance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>“To-day,” said he, “is the day of the
exhibition. Will you accompany me? I
have a free pass.”</p>

<p>“But my husband?” said she, doubtfully.
“I cannot leave him.”</p>

<p>“I have provided for that. I have
brought a nurse with me, who will take
your place, and remain here with your husband.
She is skilful and experienced, and
you can safely trust him in her hands.”</p>

<p>Here the sleeper awoke, and Mary introduced
Mr. Sedley to her husband. The
latter thanked him warmly for the interest
he had manifested in their welfare, and insisted
on Mary’s accompanying him to the
exhibition.</p>

<p>“Though I shall have no part in it,” he
said, “I still wish to hear all about it.”</p>

<p>Mary could no longer refuse, but, dressing
herself as neatly as her limited wardrobe
would admit, prepared to accompany
Mr. Sedley. To her surprise, she found a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
private carriage waiting, with the usual accompaniments
of a coachman and a footman;
the latter of whom very deferentially opened
the door of the carriage, and waited for her
to enter.</p>

<p>She began to entertain new ideas of her
companion’s consequence. The carriage
dashed boldly through the narrow streets,
until it emerged from them into the more
fashionable and crowded thoroughfares.</p>

<p>Mary found sufficient to amuse her in the
splendid carriages, many of them surmounted
with a coronet, all hastening in the same
direction with themselves. There was an
unusual number in the streets,—a circumstance
which was easily explained by the
interest and curiosity which had been awakened
by the exhibition.</p>

<p>At length, they reached the magnificent
hall in which it was to be held. The porter
bowed deferentially to Mr. Sedley as he
made way for him to pass.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>And now they are in the room. What a
magnificent collection! It represented the
combined genius of the British artists, nearly
all of whom had contributed to it. Mary,
who, though no artist, had caught something
of the spirit from her husband, looked about
her in speechless admiration.</p>

<p>“This is indeed grand!” said she, at last.
“It surpasses my highest expectations.”</p>

<p>“It is indeed,” said Mr. Sedley. “England
has good cause to be proud of her
artists. But see! do you not recognize an
old acquaintance?”</p>

<p>Mary looked, and, to her unbounded
surprise, beheld “The Transfiguration of
Christ”—her husband’s painting—suspended
against the wall. Mr. Sedley hastened
to explain.</p>

<p>“I thought it a pity,” he said, “that so
fine a picture should be lost to the exhibition.
I accordingly hired an artist to give it
the last touches, and had it brought here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>Mary thanked him with a glance full of
gratitude. She looked again, and beheld
her husband’s picture surrounded by eager
admirers. Among them were the titled and
noble; and it was with an emotion of pride
that she heard the expressions of admiration
which it elicited, and the eager questionings
as to the author’s name.</p>

<p>“I do not know,” she heard one say: “I
believe it is some <i lang="fr">protégé</i> of Sir Francis
Sedley. At all events, he presented it.”</p>

<p>“Sir Francis Sedley?” she inquired,
pausing, and looking in her companion’s
face.</p>

<p>“I cannot deny it,” said he, smiling.
“But come: let us draw nearer to the
head of the hall: the prizes are to be announced.”</p>

<p>They pressed forward; and the chairman
of the committee arose, and after a few preliminary
remarks, in which he commented
on the difficulty they had experienced in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
making the award, and congratulated himself
on the splendid collection which had
that day been brought together, announced
that the first prize, of five hundred pounds,
was awarded to Arthur Elliott for his painting
entitled “The Transfiguration.”</p>

<p>Loud shouts rang through the hall.</p>

<p>Mary was oppressed by the fulness of her
joy.</p>

<p>“Let me go out into the air,—I shall
feel relieved,” she said.</p>

<p>Sir Francis kindly accompanied her.</p>

<p>“Oh, sir!” said she, “it is to you that
we are indebted for this great joy. Poor
Arthur! how he will be delighted!”</p>

<p>“Will you not return to him and communicate
it?” asked Sir Francis.</p>

<p>A hackney coach was called, and Mrs.
Elliott soon arrived at her lodgings.</p>

<p>“Oh, Arthur!” said she. “The prize!
the prize!” It was all that she could
utter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>“Who has got it?” asked the sick man,
eagerly, as he rose in his bed.</p>

<p>“It is yours! They have awarded it to
you!”</p>

<p>A proud flush passed over the faint cheek
of the artist. “I am satisfied,—I am
happy,” said he.</p>

<p>The joy occasioned by his success operated
most beneficially on the sunken energies
of the artist. Before many weeks, he
recovered fully, so as to resume his art.
His prize painting was sold for a great sum
to an English nobleman, who was bent on
adding it to his collection.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At present, there is a beautiful cottage
situated a few miles out of London, in the
suburbs. There is a pleasant garden connected
with it, and it seems the abode of
peace and happiness. This is the residence
of the eminent artist, Arthur Elliott, and
his happy wife. There are few households<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
to whom it has fallen to enjoy such unalloyed
happiness as theirs. They have not
forgotten the author of their prosperity.
In the library of Sir Francis Sedley there
hangs a beautiful picture,—a perfect gem
of art,—on the back of which is traced, in
delicate characters,—</p>

<p class="center gothic">“Arthur Elliott to his Benefactor.”</p>

<h2 id="LOST_AND_FOUND">LOST AND FOUND.</h2>

<h3>I.</h3>

<p>We are apt to look to the Old World exclusively
for startling contrasts between fashion
and splendor on the one hand, and squalid
wretchedness and crime on the other. With
an air of complacency, we speak of our
great and happy republic, as affording a retreat
for the homeless, and a refuge for the
oppressed. Yet, in the face of all this, it
would be difficult to find in any European
city a more thoroughly vicious district than
that of the Five Points in New York.
Few, doubtless, of the fashionable crowds
who daily promenade Broadway, have ever
penetrated its recesses,—few but would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
shrink in dismay from horrors of which they
had not even dreamed, if they should do so.
But it is not our purpose to moralize upon
that which has already begun to attract the
attention, and inspire the exertions, of philanthropic
hearts and hands. That task we
leave to abler pens. Enough that we have
hinted at the character of the locality in
which our story takes its rise.</p>

<p>One of the worst recesses of this notorious
district enjoys the singularly euphonious
name of “Cow Bay.” The entrance to it
is a filthy arched passage-way, round which
are crowded miserable tenements; so miserable,
that the scanty sunlight, which finds
its way through the dirt-begrimed windows,
seems to shrink away, as if it were
more than half ashamed of the company it
is in. In front of these houses, you may
see men whose faces betray no evidence of
intelligence or virtue; women whose miserable
and woe-begone expression, perchance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
loud voice and angry vituperation, attest that
from them all that renders the sex attractive
has for ever departed; children—and this
is the saddest sight of all—dirty and
sickly, and who are children only in size
and in years; for upon their hearts the
happy influences of genuine childhood have
never fallen. For them, alas! life is a rough
pathway, paved with flinty stones, which
pierce their feet at every step.</p>

<p>A tall man, with a shambling gait, and
hat drawn over his eyes, walked swiftly
through the arched passage-way above alluded
to, and, muttering an imprecation
upon a child who got in his way, entered
one of the houses, whose front door stood
invitingly open, and, groping his way up the
staircase, which was quite obscure, although
it was mid-day, opened a door at the head
of the staircase, and entered.</p>

<p>It was such a room as the appearance of
the house might lead one to expect. It was,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
however, furnished more ambitiously; as at
least one-half the floor was covered with a
rag carpet, and the scanty furniture was
arranged with rather more taste than might
have been anticipated. By the window sat
a girl of twelve, sewing. Between her and
the children who were playing outside there
was a wide contrast. She was perfectly
clean and neat in her attire; and her face,
though pale,—as it might well be, shut up
as she was in a noisome quarter of a great
city, with no chance to breathe the fresh country
air, or roam at will through green fields,—was
unusually winning and attractive.</p>

<p>The man we have referred to threw himself
with an air of weariness on a chair
near the door, and muttered ungraciously,—</p>

<p>“Why haven’t you got dinner ready?
I’m hungry.”</p>

<p>“Is it time?” asked the child, springing
from her seat quickly, as if afraid of having
neglected her duty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>“Time enough,” returned the man; “for
I’ve been at work this morning, and have
got an appetite like a wolf. Besides, I want
you to be through soon; for I shall send you
out shopping this afternoon. Has any one
been in to see me this forenoon, Helen?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Helen (for that was her
name).</p>

<p>“Good. I don’t care to have visitors.”</p>

<p>Helen quickly brought out, from a closet
hard by, a plate of cold meat, some cold
vegetables, and a plate of bread and butter.
The man drew his chair to the table, and
during the next quarter of an hour, in
which he was so busily occupied with satisfying
his appetite that he had no time for
any thing else, said not a word to the child,
who, on her part, was too much accustomed
to his manner to utter a word.</p>

<p>At length, having accomplished his task
in a manner so satisfactory that very little
remained on the table, he drew his chair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
away, and motioned the child to take her
place at it.</p>

<p>“Take your place and eat, Helen,” said
he, a little less gruffly than before; “and,
while you are eating, I will tell you of a
little plan I have formed for you.”</p>

<p>“How do you like living here?” he resumed
when she had seated herself.</p>

<p>She looked into his face, as if to know
whether it would do to express her real
opinion. His face was not so forbidding
as it appeared at times, and she ventured to
say,—</p>

<p>“I—I think there are some places which
I should like better.”</p>

<p>“No doubt, no doubt, Helen. I think I
have known pleasanter places myself. But
where do you think you should like to live
best; that is, supposing you could live
wherever you chose?”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said the child, her eyes brightening,
and her whole face glowing with excitement,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
“I should like, above all things, to
live in the country, where I could run about
the fields, and hear the birds sing, and—and⸺ Oh!
the country is so beautiful!
I think I lived there once,—did I not,
uncle?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Helen; but it is a good while ago.
How would you like to live there once
more?”</p>

<p>“May I? Can I? Will you let me?”
asked the child, eagerly.</p>

<p>“Perhaps so. But it will depend on
whether you will be good, and try to please
me.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I will do whatever you say.”</p>

<p>“Well, that sounds well. Then I’ll tell
you what my plans are, and where it is that
you are to go.”</p>

<p>So saying, he drew from his pocket a
copy of the “New York Tribune,” and
read aloud the following advertisement:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Wanted</span>, by a family a few miles distant from the
city, a young girl, of from twelve to fourteen, to serve
as nursery-maid and companion for two young children.
Address</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">P. H. Gregory</span>.”</p>

</div>

<p>“There,” said the reader, laying down
his paper, “is a situation which will just
suit you. You like children; and pretty
much all you will have to do will be to
attend to them. Then Mr. Gregory lives in
a beautiful place. He is a rich man, and
can afford it. Would you like to go?”</p>

<p>“Above all things,” said Helen, eagerly
(for to her the prospect of a release from the
dismal place in which she lived was most
pleasing).</p>

<p>“And you wouldn’t miss me, your affectionate
uncle?” said the man, with a peculiar
expression.</p>

<p>The child’s eyes fell. She blamed herself
frequently for not holding in higher regard
the only relative of whom she knew any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
thing: yet so ungenial was his nature, and
so harsh and forbidding was he nearly
always, that it would have been singular
if he had inspired affection in any one.
So it happened, that, in the joy of the anticipated
change, she had not for a moment
thought of the separation which it must
occasion between herself and her uncle.</p>

<p>“Of course,” she said, timidly, “I shall
be sorry to leave you”——</p>

<p>“You needn’t say any thing more, child,”
was the reply. “I don’t profess any particular
affection for you, and I don’t believe
you feel any for me; and you may be sure
I shouldn’t have proposed this removal to
you if I had not some object of my own
in it. Would you like to know what that
is?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said, hesitatingly.</p>

<p>“Well, I will tell you; because it is necessary
that you should fully understand,
before you go, on what conditions I allow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
you to do so. But, if you dare to impart to
a breathing soul a hint of what I tell you, I
will seek you out, and—well, no matter,”
he continued, seeing that his threat made
her turn pale. “You must know that this
Mr. Gregory, with whom I am going to
place you, once cheated me out of a large
sum of money, which I cannot hope to regain,
except by stratagem. Now, I want you
to get in there, and I will then give you
instructions how to manage. They keep a
large amount of valuable plate in the lower
part of the house. It will be comparatively
easy for you, when you are once there, to
render me essential service by opening the
front door to me, so that I may be able to
secure it without detection; and then”——</p>

<p>“But,” said the girl, shrinking in dismay
from this proposition, “would not that be
robbery?”</p>

<p>“Robbery? Pooh, child! Didn’t I tell
you that he had cheated me out of twice the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
value of the plate? And, as I can’t get my
pay in any other way, it’s perfectly proper
to get it in that.”</p>

<p>Helen was no casuist. She had never
had any one to teach her right principles;
but she had an instinctive feeling that this
was wrong. She wished to remonstrate, but
dared not. Her uncle saw her embarrassment,
and guessed its cause. He rose from
his seat, and stood sternly confronting her.</p>

<p>“Helen Armstrong,” said he, in a compressed
voice, “unless you promise me
faithfully to perform the part I have assigned
you, I will bind you out to Brady
Tim, the grocer.”</p>

<p>This Brady Tim was a repulsive character,
and kept a grocery of the lowest kind
nearly opposite the rooms occupied by the
girl and her uncle. He was a complete
tyrant, and would often beat his children
in the most unmerciful manner. Their
shrieks, which she was often doomed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
hear, would always make her blood run
cold, and inspired her with an inconceivable
dread of the man who occasioned them.
This her uncle well understood; and he
was well aware that no threat which he
could utter would make so deep an impression
upon the child’s mind.</p>

<p>“You have your choice,” said he. “Shall
I tell Brady Tim that you will come to-morrow
morning? or will you go to Mr.
Gregory’s?”</p>

<p>“I will go,” said the child, overawed.</p>

<p>“And you will follow my directions?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Then preparations must instantly be
made. I shall have to buy you a few
things to have you go looking decently.
Have you got a good bonnet?”</p>

<p>“Only my old one, and that is bent every
way.”</p>

<p>“Well, I will get you a new one. You
will also want a shawl and some gloves. As<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
you are to be a companion to the children,
it will be a recommendation if you go
looking neat and comfortable. It won’t
take long to purchase them; and whatever
else you need I can send you afterwards.
Wait a moment, and I will be ready to
accompany you.”</p>

<p>He went into the inner room, and quickly
emerged, completely metamorphosed in his
personal appearance by a white wig and
whiskers, and a staff, on which he leaned
heavily. The girl looked at him in astonishment.</p>

<p>“What sort of a grandfather do you
think I shall make?” said he, laughing.
“I shall go out with you to Mr. Gregory’s;
and I have no doubt, that, in consideration
of my gray hairs, they will be induced to
take my grand-daughter into their service.”</p>

<p>So saying, he left the room, accompanied
by the child, who had improved the interval
in smoothing her hair, over which she placed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
an ugly straw bonnet, which, however, was
shortly to be displaced by one of a prettier
pattern. Their purchases completed, they
stepped into an omnibus, which would convey
them within half a mile of Mr. Gregory’s.</p>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p>A few miles distant from the city was a
tasteful brown cottage, having a piazza on
all sides, and surrounded by a carefully
trained hedge. This was the summer retreat
of P. H. Gregory, a New York
merchant.</p>

<p>It was a warm day in June. Two children,
a boy and girl, respectively of six and
eight years, were playing in the yard, when
they espied through the hedge an old man,
with hair and whiskers white as the driven
snow, accompanied by a young girl, toiling,
apparently with great difficulty, towards the
house, notwithstanding the assistance he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
derived from a stout cane, on which he
leaned heavily.</p>

<p>Attracted by the sight, they ran into the
house, calling on their mother to look out
and see. She had scarcely done so, when,
to her surprise, she found that the pair had
entered the gate, and were coming towards
the house.</p>

<p>“Is Mrs. Gregory within?” asked the
old man of the servant who answered the
bell.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gregory anticipated the reply by
coming forward.</p>

<p>“Poor old man!” said she, compassionately
(for the attire which Armstrong had
donned for the occasion was singularly
threadbare, and evinced the lowest depth
of destitution),—“poor old man! what can
I do for you?”</p>

<p>“I have brought my grand-daughter with
me, good lady,” said the old man, feebly,
“in answer to your advertisement. She’s a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
good girl, and I wish I could keep her with
me; but the times are hard, and it costs a
sight to live; and so I’ve been thinking the
best thing I could do is to get her a good
place, and a good mistress, as I am sure you
would be to her, madam.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Gregory’s sympathies were enlisted
in the child’s favor by this artful address, as
well as by her own modest and downcast
look. She was not aware, however, that
not a little of her confusion arose from the
dissimulation in which she was compelled
to take a part.</p>

<p>“What is your grand-daughter’s name?”
asked Mrs. Gregory. “She seems young.”</p>

<p>“She is only twelve; but she’s capable,—very
capable. When her poor grandmother
was sick for nearly a year before
she died,”—and Armstrong wiped his
eyes with his ragged sleeve at the sorrowful
thought,—“Helen took the whole care of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
her and of me; and no one could find a better
nurse.”</p>

<p>“It must have been a great care to you,
Helen,” said Mrs. Gregory, kindly.</p>

<p>Helen had been so much taken aback by
the last fabrication respecting a grandmother
of whom she had never heard, that she was
barely able to say, in a low voice,—</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am.”</p>

<p>“But you will never regret it, my child,”
said the lady. “God will not fail to reward
good children. So your name is Helen?”</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am.”</p>

<p>“I like the name. I had a child of that
name once. Were she living, she would be
about your age. But”—and the lady
sighed deeply—“she disappeared one day,
and we never could find any trace of her.”</p>

<p>Had Mrs. Gregory been an attentive observer,
she would have seen a gleam of
intelligence pass over the old man’s face<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
at this moment; but she was too much
absorbed by her sad thoughts.</p>

<p>“I think,” said she, after a pause, “that
I will engage you, Helen, although you are
rather young for my purpose. When can
you come?”</p>

<p>“She is ready now,” said her grandfather.
“I can send her the rest of her clothes.”</p>

<p>“Very well. Then you may come in,
and take off your things.”</p>

<p>“Come, Helen, and give a parting kiss to
your poor old grandfather. He will be very
lonely without you, my dear child; but he
knows that he has left you with a kind lady,
who will care for you.”</p>

<p>Helen advanced to her grandfather’s embrace
with very little alacrity. As he pressed
his lips lightly to her cheek, he whispered,
so that she only could hear,—</p>

<p>“Keep your eyes open;” and then added
aloud, “Be a good girl, Helen, and mind
the kind lady who has engaged you, in all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
respects. Remember all the lessons I have
taught you; and do not forget,” he continued,
with a meaning look, “what I told
you before I came away.”</p>

<p>Helen replied faintly in the affirmative.
Mrs. Gregory attributed her evident embarrassment
to the fact that she was about
to leave her only relative to go among
strangers; and she resolved in her heart to
lighten, as well as she might, the sorrow of
the child.</p>

<p>“I will bring your clothes to-morrow,
my dear grand-daughter,” said Armstrong,
as he rose slowly from his chair, and, resuming
his cane, walked feebly from the
house.</p>

<p>As soon, however, as he was fully out of
sight, he straightened his bowed form, and
walked rapidly onward till overtaken by a
passing omnibus, which he entered, and was
soon carried back to the city.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<h3>III.</h3>

<p>Helen was not long in making the acquaintance
of Ellen and Frank Gregory, the
children of her employer, over whom she
was expected thenceforth to have oversight.</p>

<p>Those who have always lived in the country,
or to whom frequent visits have made
it familiar, can hardly appreciate the depth
of enjoyment which it brought to a child,
who, like Helen, had been confined for
years in the most noisome portion of a great
city. To her, the most common objects
seemed invested with an interest altogether
new; and she plucked with as much eagerness
the dandelions and buttercups which
covered the greensward in profusion as if
they had been the rarest exotics. There
is a freemasonry in children which does
away with formal introductions and the barriers
of etiquette. When, two hours after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
her companion’s departure, Helen and the
children came bounding in, flushed with
exercise, Mrs. Gregory had an opportunity
to observe—what before had escaped her
notice—that Helen was more than ordinarily
pretty. Something there was in her
expression that seemed to strike the chords
of memory; but Mrs. Gregory dismissed it
as only a chance resemblance.</p>

<p>“Helen,” said she, calling the child to
her side, “have you always lived in the
city?”</p>

<p>“For a long time, madam. I cannot remember
ever to have lived anywhere else.”</p>

<p>“And do you like it as well as the country?”</p>

<p>“I do not like it at all,—it is so dark
and dirty and close. The sun does not
shine there as it does here; and I could
not run out into the fields, but all day long
I had to sit alone.”</p>

<p>“Alone? Wasn’t your grandfather with
you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes,” said Helen, casting down her
eyes. “He would come home to meals;
but he had to attend to his business.”</p>

<p>“He seems too old and infirm to be able
to do much,” said Mrs. Gregory, compassionately.</p>

<p>Helen was about to disclaim the age and
infirmity, when the thought of the near relation
in which Armstrong stood to her
came over her mind in time, and she only
answered, “Yes, ma’am.”</p>

<p>“How long since your grandmother
died?”</p>

<p>This, too, was an embarrassing question
for Helen; but the necessity of saying
something prompted her to reply, “A good
while.”</p>

<p>Perceiving, though she could not conjecture
why, that her questions confused Helen,
Mrs. Gregory desisted.</p>

<p>It was about four o’clock on the succeeding
afternoon that Mrs. Gregory, who was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
sitting at the window, detected the bent
form of the assumed old man slowly making
his way up the hill.</p>

<p>“Your grandfather is coming,” said she
to Helen, who sat beside her.</p>

<p>Helen tried to look as joyful as the
approach of her only relative might be
expected to make her; but the thought of
the deception which she was even then
practising towards a family who were showing
her great kindness, and the still greater
wrong which she was required to do them,
made it a difficult task for one no better
versed in dissimulation.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gregory noticed it no further than
to form the opinion that she was a little odd
in her manners.</p>

<p>As Helen expected, Armstrong requested
her to walk a little apart with him; and
then, dropping at once the whining tone he
had assumed, inquired, quickly and peremptorily,—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, what have you discovered?”</p>

<p>“Nothing,” said Helen, timidly, and as
if deprecating his anger.</p>

<p>“Nothing?” he echoed, his eyes lighting
with indignation. “What am I to
understand by that?</p>

<p>“Come, child,” said he, softening his
tone, as he saw that she was terrified by
his roughness, “I don’t mean you any
harm; but the fact is, I have placed you
here to help me, and help me you must,
otherwise I shall be compelled to carry
you back to live with me in New York.
Perhaps you would like to go?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, no!” said Helen. “Don’t
carry me back! Let me stay here!”</p>

<p>“Well, so I will, if you behave well.
Now, tell me truly, have you no idea where
they keep the silver? I know they have a
large quantity of it.”</p>

<p>Helen reluctantly admitted, that, although
she did not know, she could form an idea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>“Where?” asked Armstrong, eagerly.</p>

<p>“In the pantry, at the west corner of the
house.”</p>

<p>“Humph! And do they lock the door
at night?”</p>

<p>“Yes; but the key remains in the lock.”</p>

<p>“So far, so good. Does any one sleep in
the lower part of the house?”</p>

<p>“No one.”</p>

<p>“Better still.”</p>

<p>A moment afterwards, Armstrong added,
a new thought striking him,—</p>

<p>“I have not seen any dog near the house.
Do they keep any?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“That is lucky. A determined dog is
sometimes a troublesome customer. I recollect,
one night, Dick Hargrave and I had
planned a little expedition of this kind, when
it was all broken up by a cursed bull-dog,
who rushed out upon us as if he would tear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
us to pieces; and, to tell the truth, he did
tear Dick’s coat off his back.”</p>

<p>Helen listened in dismay; for it revealed
to her what she had not known,—that her
uncle had been implicated in affairs of a
similar kind before. It will be remembered
that Armstrong, in proposing to her
to co-operate with him, had used the pretext
that Mr. Gregory had cheated him, and that
he was resolved to repay himself. This,
Helen had believed at the time; but his
present unguarded remarks led her to entertain
strong doubts of its truth. Her strong
natural dislike for the duplicity and treachery
required at her hands determined her,
in spite of her habitual timidity and fear of
her companion, to venture a remonstrance.
This, however, she delayed till he should
make a specific demand upon her.</p>

<p>He resumed: “I don’t know but there’s
a pretty good chance of success. To-night
is Tuesday night. I can’t very well get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
ready before Friday. On that night, you
must contrive, in some manner,—taking
care to incur no suspicion,—to come
down stairs and unlock the front door. I
shall be on hand at one o’clock. Be very
particular about the time; for what I do
must be done quickly.”</p>

<p>“But, uncle, wouldn’t that be robbery?”</p>

<p>“Robbery! Didn’t I tell you that old
Gregory had cheated me out of more than
the sum I shall take?”</p>

<p>“But they have treated me kindly; and
it makes me feel ashamed to know that I
am trying to injure them, uncle”——</p>

<p>“Don’t call me uncle again! I’m no
uncle of yours,” said Armstrong, roughly.
Noticing the child’s look of surprise, he
added, “There, the murder is out! I had
intended to treat you as a niece; but you
don’t deserve it. It is time to talk to you in
a different strain. I declare to you, Helen,
that, unless you comply with my command,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
I will make you repent it most bitterly. Do
you hear?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Helen, terrified no less by
his looks than his words.</p>

<p>“Then take care that you remember:
Friday night, at one. And now, as we
understand each other, that is all that is
necessary.”</p>

<p>They returned to the house in silence.
Armstrong, with a hypocritical whine,
thanked Mrs. Gregory for her kindness to
his dear grand-daughter, who, he was glad
to find, seemed so contented and happy in
her new position.</p>

<p>“You will pardon an old man’s tears,”
said he, drawing his hand across his eyes;
“but she is all that is left to me now.”</p>

<p>“What a good old man!” thought Mrs.
Gregory, as she hastened to assure him that
whatever she could do to add to the comfort
of his grand-daughter would cheerfully be
done.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>As for Helen, she was astonished and confused
at what she had discovered. She had
always been led to believe that Armstrong
was her uncle, and had more than once
reproached herself for the dislike she could
not help entertaining for him. Now he had
himself disclaimed the relationship; and
Helen was left to conjecture fruitlessly who
and what she was.</p>

<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>We must carry the reader back some nine
or ten years. In front of a pleasant country
residence, a child of three years sat on
the grass, plucking the flowers that grew
at her feet, and then tossing them from her.
Ever and anon she would utter a cry of
childish delight, as a gaudily-painted butterfly
flew past her, and would stretch out
her little hands to arrest its flight; but the
wanderer of the air found no difficulty in
eluding the tiny hands of the child.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>At length, as if weary of her pastime,
she rose from her grassy seat, and tottled
towards the open gate, out of which she
passed, and strayed along the path by the
roadside, pausing where fancy prompted.
Her disappearance had not been noted by
those in the house, partly because their attention
was occupied by a tall, swarthy
woman, with fierce black eyes, who was at
that moment asking, or rather demanding,
alms of the mistress of the house.</p>

<p>“We are not in the habit,” said the latter,
“of giving money; but whatever food you
may require will be cheerfully given.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want any food,” said the woman,
abruptly. “You talk as if victuals was the
only thing one could need. I have had
something to eat already. I want money,
I tell you.”</p>

<p>“Then why don’t you work for it?”
asked the lady, somewhat offended at the
boldness of her speech.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>“Because I don’t see why I should work
my life out while others are living in plenty.
There are plenty of fine ladies who wouldn’t
lift their fingers if it was to save a life. Am
I not as good as they? Why, then, should
they fare any better than I?”</p>

<p>“That I do not pretend to say. I only
know that he is most happy who strives to
content himself with that station in which
the Almighty has placed him.”</p>

<p>“Oh! it is all very well for those to talk
of being contented who have every thing to
make them so. Very praiseworthy it is,
to be sure!” said the woman, laughing
scornfully.</p>

<p>The violence of her language increased to
such an extent, that Mrs. Gregory—for it
was she—found it necessary to order her
to leave the house. She did so, but not
without many imprecations. As she strode
along with hasty steps, she espied by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
roadside a little girl, holding in her hand a
flower that she had just plucked.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it <em>pitty</em>?” said the child, holding
it up.</p>

<p>A thought struck the woman, and she
arrested her steps.</p>

<p>“Where do you live, little girl?” she
asked, softening her voice as much as practicable,
so as not to alarm the child.</p>

<p>“I live there,” said the little girl, pointing
to the house the woman had just quitted.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” muttered the latter to herself;
“you’re the child of that proud lady
that refused me what I asked. Perhaps she
may repent it.”</p>

<p>“Would you like to go with me?” she
asked, turning once more to the child. “I
will show you where there are flowers a
great deal prettier.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the unsuspecting child, gaining
her feet, and placing her hand in the
woman’s.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>Was there no magic in the soft touch of
that little hand that could turn away that
bad woman from her wicked purpose?</p>

<p>Alas! when the heart becomes familiar
with crime, all the gentler parts of the
nature become hard and callous.</p>

<p>“Would you like to have me take you in
my arms, and then we should get there
quicker?” said the woman, who knew it
would not do to accommodate herself to the
child’s slow pace.</p>

<p>The latter made no resistance; and, with
the little girl in her arms, the woman walked
swiftly along. She soon turned aside from
the street, for fear of attracting a degree of
observation,—which, under present circumstances,
would be embarrassing to her,—and
took her way, by a less frequented
road, to the city.</p>

<p>The child soon became restless, and
wished to go home. The woman assured
her that she was carrying her there. Before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
long, the regular motion of walking acted
as a sedative upon the child, and she fell
asleep. Her bearer made the most of this
opportunity, and walked with quickened
steps towards her haunt—for home she had
none—in the great city, which she had already
entered. Some whom she met gazed
with curious eyes at the woman and her
burden, and could not help noting the contrast
between the two in dress: but no one
felt called upon to interfere; and so she
reached her destination.</p>

<p>The next day saw Helen—for this the
woman discovered to be the child’s name—stripped
of her tasteful attire, and clothed
in a ragged and dirty dress, suited to the
company into which she had fallen. At the
same time, her abundant curls were cut off
close to her head, principally to render more
difficult the chance of recognition.</p>

<p>The woman found Helen of essential service
in her line. Though disfigured by her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
uncouth dress and the loss of her curls,
her beauty was sufficiently striking to draw
many a coin from compassionate strangers,
which would not otherwise have been obtained.
This little episode completed, we
resume the main thread of our narrative.</p>

<h3>V.</h3>

<p>Notwithstanding the kind treatment which
Helen received in her new home, she did not
seem happy. Although the companions
among which she had been thrown had
not been of a nature to give her very elevated
ideas of moral rectitude, something
within told her that the act required of
her would be one of the basest ingratitude.
The more she thought of it, the more her
heart recoiled from it. Yet so accustomed
was she to obey the man Armstrong without
question,—not so much from affection as
from fear and a sense of duty,—that she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
had hardly admitted to herself the possibility
of refusing to comply with his demands.
Now, however, that he had himself confessed
that no relationship existed between
them, the force of the latter consideration
was not a little weakened; and, as fear decreases
in the absence of those who inspire
it, she began now to consider in what way
she could contrive to avoid it.</p>

<p>Circumstances occurred before the dreaded
Friday night which served to hasten her
decision. On the day previous, while roaming
through the fields with Ellen and Frank
Gregory, in jumping hastily from a stone
wall, her foot turned, and her ankle was
severely sprained. The pain was so violent
that she nearly fainted, and was quite unable
to make her way to the house, which
was some quarter of a mile distant. The
children were exceedingly frightened, and,
returning in breathless haste, gave an immediate
alarm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>Two men were speedily obtained, who,
constructing a soft litter, conveyed Helen to
the house, without occasioning her much
additional pain. A physician was at once
summoned. Meanwhile, Helen was put
to bed, where she received every attention.
Mrs. Gregory had a warm heart, which suffering
in any form was sure to reach; and,
had Helen been her own child, she could
not have been more tenderly cared for.</p>

<p>The physician decided that it was nothing
very serious; though he recommended, as a
necessary precaution, that the injured member
should not be used for a fortnight or
more, lest inflammation might ensue.</p>

<p>Helen did not hear him pronounce this
sentence. When, however, she was informed
of it by Mrs. Gregory, after his
departure, her mind at once reverted to
the fact that it would be an insuperable
obstacle to her performing the part assigned
her. Actuated by the relief which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
thought brought to her, and without thinking
of the manner in which it would be
construed, she involuntarily exclaimed,—</p>

<p>“Oh! I am so glad!”</p>

<p>“Glad!” exclaimed Mrs. Gregory, in astonishment.
“What can you mean? You
surely cannot mean that you are glad you
will be confined to the house by sickness?”</p>

<p>Helen was embarrassed. She knew she
could not explain herself without telling
all; and that she had not yet determined
upon. At length she said,—</p>

<p>“Because it will prevent me from doing
something that I did not want to do.”</p>

<p>“But why did you not want to do it?”
asked Mrs. Gregory.</p>

<p>“Because I do not think it would have
been right.”</p>

<p>“Then why would you have done it at
all, even if you had been well enough, if it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
was wrong?” asked Mrs. Gregory, more
puzzled than ever.</p>

<p>“Because I was afraid to refuse,” said
Helen, in a low tone.</p>

<p>“It was nothing that I required of you, I
am sure,” said her mistress.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“It surely could not be that your grandfather
would require of you any thing improper?”</p>

<p>Helen was silent.</p>

<p>“Then it is so. My dear child,” pursued
the lady, kindly, “I have lived longer than
you, and naturally have more knowledge of
the world. I need not say that I have every
disposition to befriend you, not only for your
own sake, but for the sake of my own little
Helen, who, had she remained to me, would
have been about your age. Will you not,
then, confide in me so far as to inform me
what it was that your grandfather required
of you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>Helen considered a moment, and then,
with a rapidity of decision which sometimes
comes after long and anxious thought, decided
to communicate every thing.</p>

<p>“I will tell you every thing,” she said,
“if you will promise that no harm shall
come to the man who brought me here.”</p>

<p>“Your grandfather?”</p>

<p>“Will you promise?” asked Helen, anxiously.</p>

<p>“Yes, Helen,” said Mrs. Gregory:
“though I cannot conceive what is to be
the nature of your revelation, I will promise
that no harm shall befall your grandfather.”</p>

<p>“You are so good and kind,” said the
child, “that I can trust to what you say.
Then I will tell you, first of all, that the
one who came with me is not my grandfather.”</p>

<p>“Not your grandfather?” echoed Mrs.
Gregory, in surprise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>“No. He is not even an old man. He
only dressed himself up so when he came
here.”</p>

<p>“And what made him do that?”</p>

<p>“Because he thought you would pity
him, and be more ready to take me.”</p>

<p>“Is he any relation to you?”</p>

<p>“I thought he was my uncle,” returned
Helen, “until he came here last time. Then
he told me that he was no relation.”</p>

<p>“Where are your relations?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said Helen, thoughtfully.
“I suppose I must have had some
once; but I can’t remember any thing about
them. I have lived with my—I mean
Mr. Armstrong, ever since I can recollect.”</p>

<p>“And what was it he wanted you to
do? Why was he so anxious to have you
come here?”</p>

<p>“Because⸺ You mustn’t blame me,”
said Helen, earnestly, lifting her eyes to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
Mrs. Gregory’s face; “for it made me very
unhappy to think of doing it. But he
wanted me to leave the door open to-morrow
night, so that he could get in and
carry off the silver.”</p>

<p>“Is it possible?” exclaimed Mrs. Gregory.
“And he wished to implicate you in
such a crime?”</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am,” said Helen. “He told
me that was what he wanted me to come
here for; and then I didn’t want to come at
all. But he threatened me if I did not.
Then, when he was here last time, I tried
to persuade him to give up his design; but
he wouldn’t listen to me, and I didn’t dare
to say any thing more.”</p>

<p>“You said, Helen,” remarked Mrs. Gregory,
“that you never knew about your
relations. Can’t you remember any thing
that happened when you was a little
child?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Helen, “not much; but I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
think I must have lived in the country
once, though I can’t remember when.
There was an old woman, very cross, that
I used to be with before Mr. Armstrong
took me. She used to beat me sometimes.”</p>

<p>“How did she look?” said the lady,
feeling a strange interest—for which she
found it difficult to account—in the child’s
story.</p>

<p>“She was very tall; and she used to look
at me—oh! so fiercely!”</p>

<p>“And is there nothing, no little keepsake,
that you have, to remind you of those
childish days?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Helen, “there was one. It
was an ivory ring that I have always carried
around with me. The tall woman tried to
take it away from me one day; but I cried
so that she let me keep it.”</p>

<p>“Have you got it with you?” asked Mrs.
Gregory, in great agitation.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Helen, surprised at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
strange effect this communication appeared
to have upon her mistress. “I always carry
it in the pocket of my dress.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Gregory, with trembling hands,
sought the receptacle indicated, and drew
out an ivory ring, on which were inscribed
the letters “H. G.” Without a word, she
sprang to the bed, clasped the bewildered
Helen to her bosom, and exclaimed, tearfully,—</p>

<p>“It is as I thought! You are my child!—my
long-lost Helen!”</p>

<p>When her emotion had in some measure
subsided, she made Helen acquainted with
the circumstances mentioned in the previous
chapter, and also informed her that the ring,
which had served as the happy means of
restoring a long-lost child to her parent,
was the gift of a brother of hers, who had
inscribed upon it “H. G.,” as the initials
of Helen’s name, and that the child had it
with her on the day of her disappearance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>The happiness of Helen in being restored
to her mother, and the joy of the children
on ascertaining that the one whom they had
learned to love so well, already, was their
own sister, may better be imagined than
described.</p>

<p>One leaf remains to be added to this chronicle.
It relates to Armstrong, hitherto the
guardian of Helen. Although the latter had
received at his hands so little for which she
had occasion to be thankful, she could not
reconcile herself to the idea of his being
imprisoned. We cannot look with indifference
upon the punishment of one with
whom we have been intimately associated,
however well deserved it may be.</p>

<p>As Armstrong had no intimation of the
check which his projects had received, and
as he was convinced that Helen’s fear of
him would lead her to carry out his commands,
he stealthily approached the house
the following evening, as he had intended.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
The door had been purposely left unlocked;
but, in the room adjoining, four stout men
had been stationed, who at once seized upon
the unsuspecting burglar, and, in spite of
his violent struggles, bound him. Thus
secured, Mr. Gregory, who was one of the
four, explained to him in what manner his
crime had been defeated, and added,—</p>

<p>“Although you have been detected in
crime, and richly deserve the penalty which
the offended law affixes to it, I have been
induced by Helen to afford you a chance of
escaping. I will furnish you a ticket entitling
you to a passage in the next California
steamer, and will not reveal your guilty
attempt, if you will engage to leave the
country immediately. Should you fail to
go, I shall feel released from the promise I
have made to Helen, and at once cause you
to be arrested.”</p>

<p>It is needless to say that Armstrong at
once accepted these terms; and the next<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
steamer bound to the Pacific bore him a
passenger.</p>

<p>As for Helen, the cloud which shadowed
her earlier years has quite disappeared; and
in the affection of the home circle, to which
her many good qualities endear her, she
finds all that can make life pleasant and
agreeable.</p>

<h2 id="THE_CHRISTMAS_GIFT">THE CHRISTMAS GIFT.</h2>

<p>Heavily, heavily fell the snow, covering
the dark-brown earth, already hardened
by the frost, with a pure white covering.
As the rain falls alike upon the just and
upon the unjust; so, too, the snow, God’s
kindred messenger, knows no distinction of
persons,—visiting all alike, forgetting none,
and passing by none.</p>

<p>In one of the principal streets of New
York stood a boy of some twelve years.
His clothing was poor, and too scanty to
afford a sufficient protection against the inclemency
of the season. Through the visor
of his cap, which had become detached in
the middle, having a connection only at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
two extremities, might be seen his rich
brown hair. Notwithstanding the drawback
of his coarse and ill-fitting attire, it
was evident that he possessed a more than
ordinary share of boyish beauty. But just
at present his brow is overcast with a shade
of anxiety; and his frame trembles with the
cold, from which he is so insufficiently
shielded.</p>

<p>It is a handsome street, that in which he
is standing. On either side he beholds the
residences of those on whom Fortune has
showered her favors. Bright lights gleam
from the parlor windows, and shouts of
mirth and laughter ring out upon the
night.</p>

<p>All is joy and brightness and festivity
within those palace-homes. The snow-flakes
fall idly against the window-panes. They
cannot chill the hearts within, nor place a
bar upon their enjoyment; for this is Christmas
Eve, long awaited, at length arrived.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
Christmas Eve, around which so many
youthful anticipations cluster, has enjoyments
peculiarly its own, over which the
elements, however boisterous, have no control.
Yet, to some, Christmas Eve brings
more sorrow than enjoyment,—serving only
to heighten the contrast between present
poverty and discomfort and past affluence.</p>

<p>But all this time we have left our little
hero shivering in the street.</p>

<p>Cold and uncomfortable as he was, as
well as anxious in mind,—for he had lost
his way, and knew not how to find it again,—he
could not help forgetting his situation,
for the time, in witnessing the scene which
met his eye, as, for a moment, he stood in
front of a handsome residence on the south
side of the street. The curtains were drawn
aside; so that, by supporting himself on the
railing, he had an unobstructed view of the
scene within.</p>

<p>It was a spacious parlor, furnished in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
style elegant, but not ostentatious. In the
centre of the apartment was a Christmas-tree,
brilliant with tapers, which were gleaming
from every branch and twig. Gifts of
various kinds were hung upon the tree,
around which were gathered a group of
three children, respectively of eight, six,
and four years. The eldest was a winsome
fairy, with sparkling eyes and dancing feet.
The others were boys, who were making the
most of this rare opportunity of sitting up
after nine o’clock. At a little distance
stood Mr. Dinsmoor and his wife, gazing
with unalloyed enjoyment at the happiness
of their children.</p>

<p>While Lizzie was indulging in expressions
of delight at the superb wax doll
which St. Nicholas had so generously provided,
her attention was for a moment
drawn to the window, through which she
distinctly saw the figure of our hero, who,
as we have said, had in his eagerness raised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
himself upon the railing outside, in order to
obtain a better view. She uttered an exclamation
of surprise.</p>

<p>“Why, mother! there’s a boy looking in
at the window! Just look at him!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Dinsmoor looked in the direction
indicated, and saw the little boy, without
his perceiving that attention had been drawn
towards him.</p>

<p>“Some poor boy,” she remarked to her
husband, in a compassionate tone, “who
loses for a moment the sensation of his own
discomfort in witnessing our happiness. See
how eagerly he looks at the tree! which no
doubt appears like something marvellous to
him.”</p>

<p>“Why can’t you let him come in?”
asked Lizzie, eagerly. “He must be very
cold out there, with the snow-flakes falling
upon him. Perhaps he would like to have
a nearer view of our tree.”</p>

<p>“Very well and kindly thought of, my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
little girl,” said Mr. Dinsmoor, placing his
hand for a moment upon her clustering
locks. “I will follow your suggestion;
but I must do it carefully, or he may be
frightened, and run away before he knows
what are our intentions.”</p>

<p>So speaking, Mr. Dinsmoor moved cautiously
to the front door, and opened it
suddenly. The boy, startled by the sound,
turned towards Mr. Dinsmoor with a frightened
air, as if fearing that he would be
suspected of some improper motive.</p>

<p>“Indeed, sir,” said he, earnestly, “I
didn’t mean any harm; but it looked so
bright and cheerful inside that I couldn’t
help looking in.”</p>

<p>“You have done nothing wrong, my
boy,” said Mr. Dinsmoor, kindly. “But
you must be cold here. Come in, and you
will have a chance to see more comfortably
than you now do.”</p>

<p>The boy looked a little doubtful; for to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
him, neglected as he had been by the rich
and prosperous all his life, it was very difficult
to imagine that he was actually invited
to enter the imposing mansion before him as
a guest. Perhaps Mr. Dinsmoor divined
his doubts; for he continued,—</p>

<p>“Come: you must not refuse the invitation.
There are some little people inside
who would be very much disappointed if
you should, since it was they who commissioned
me to invite you.”</p>

<p>“I am sure, sir, I am very much obliged
both to them and to you,” said the boy,
gratefully, advancing towards Mr. Dinsmoor,
of whom he had lost whatever little distrust
he had at first felt.</p>

<p>A moment afterwards, and the boy
stepped within the spacious parlor. To
him, whose home offered no attractions,
and few comforts, the scene spread before
him might well seem a scene of enchantment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>“Lizzie,” said Mr. Dinsmoor, “come forward
and welcome your guest. I would
introduce him to you; but, unluckily, I do
not know his name.”</p>

<p>“My name is Willie,—Willie Grant,”
was the boy’s reply.</p>

<p>“Then, Willie Grant, this is Miss Lizzie
Dinsmoor, who is, I am sure, glad to see
you, since it was at her request that I invited
you to enter.”</p>

<p>Willie raised his eyes timidly, and bent
them for a moment on the singularly beautiful
child, who had come forward and frankly
placed her hand in his.</p>

<p>There is something irresistible in the
witchery of beauty; and Willie felt a warm
glow crimsoning his cheeks, as for a moment,
forgetful of every thing else, he bent
his eyes earnestly upon Lizzie. Then another
feeling came over him; and, with a
look of shame at his scanty and ill-fitting
garments, he dropped her hand, and involuntarily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
shrank back, as if seeking to screen
them from sight.</p>

<p>Perceiving the movement, and guessing
its cause, Mr. Dinsmoor, with a view to dissipate
these feelings, led forward Harry and
Charlie, the younger boys, and told them to
make acquaintance with Willie. With loud
shouts of delight, they displayed the various
gifts which St. Nicholas had brought them,
and challenged his admiration.</p>

<p>Every thing was new to Willie. His
childhood had not been smiled upon by
Fortune; and the costly toys which the boys
exhibited elicited quite as much admiration
as they could desire.</p>

<p>Occupied in this way, his constraint gradually
wore off to such a degree that he
assisted Charlie and Harry in trying their
new toys. Soon, however, the recollection
that it was growing late, and that he had
yet to find his way home, came to him; and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
taking his old hat, he said to Mr. Dinsmoor,
in an embarrassed manner,—</p>

<p>“My mother will be expecting me home;
and I should already have been there, but
that I lost my way, and happened to look in
at your window, and you were so kind as to
let me come in.”</p>

<p>“Where does your mother live, my little
fellow?” asked Mr. Dinsmoor.</p>

<p>“On ⸺ Street.”</p>

<p>“Oh! that is not far off. I will myself
show you the way, if you will remain a few
minutes longer.”</p>

<p>Mr. Dinsmoor rang the bell, and ordered
a plate of cake and apples, as he conjectured
they would not be unacceptable to his little
visitor.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Lizzie crept to her mother’s
side, and whispered,—</p>

<p>“Willie is poor,—isn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Yes. What makes you ask?”</p>

<p>“I thought he must be, because his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
clothes look so thin, and patched. Don’t
you think he would like a Christmas present,
mother?”</p>

<p>“Yes, my darling. Have you any thing
to give him?”</p>

<p>“I thought, mother, perhaps you would
let me give him my five-dollar gold-piece.
I think that would be better than any playthings.
May I give it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, my child, if you are really willing.
But are you quite sure that you would not
regret it afterwards?”</p>

<p>“Yes, mother.” And Lizzie ran lightly
to the little box where she kept her treasure,
quickly brought it forth, and placed it in
Willie’s hand.</p>

<p>“That is your Christmas present,” said
she, gayly.</p>

<p>Willie looked surprised.</p>

<p>“Do you mean it for me?” he asked, in
a half-bewildered tone.</p>

<p>“Yes, if you like it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>“I thank you very much for your kindness,”
said Willie, earnestly, “and I will
always remember it.”</p>

<p>There was something in the boy’s earnest
tone which Lizzie felt was an ample recompense
for the little sacrifice she had made.
Mr. Dinsmoor fulfilled his promise, and
walked with Willie as far as the street in
which he lived, when, feeling sure that he
could no longer mistake his way, he left
him.</p>

<p>Mr. Dinsmoor, whom we have introduced
to our readers, was a prosperous merchant,
and counted his wealth by hundreds of
thousands. Fortunately, his disposition was
liberal; and he made the poor sharers with
him in the gifts which Fortune had so liberally
showered upon him.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the good use which he
made of his wealth, he was fated to experience
reverses,—resulting, not from his
own mismanagement, but from a general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
commercial panic, which all at once involved
in ruin many whose fortunes were
large, and whose credit was long established.
In a word, Mr. Dinsmoor failed.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Eleven years had rolled by since the
Christmas night on which our story opens.
Lizzie had not belied the promise of her
girlhood, but had developed into a radiantly
beautiful girl. Already her hand had been
sought in marriage; but, as yet, she had
seen no one on whom she could look with
that affection without which marriage would
be a mockery.</p>

<p>Charlie and Harry, too,—eleven years
had changed them not a little. The boys
of four and six had become fine, manly
youths of fifteen and seventeen. The eldest
had entered college. Harry, however, who
was by no means studious, had entered his
father’s counting-room.</p>

<p>That was a sorrowful night on which Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
Dinsmoor made known to his afflicted wife
the bankruptcy which was inevitable. Still
sadder, if possible, was the sale which it
enforced of the house which they had so
long occupied, the furniture which had
become endeared to them by memory and
association, and the harsh interruption which
loss of fortune put to all their treasured
schemes.</p>

<p>“My poor boy,” said Mrs. Dinsmoor,
sorrowfully, as she placed her hand caressingly
on the brown locks of Charlie, the
eldest of the two boys, “it will be a hard
sacrifice for you to leave the studies to which
you are so much attached, and enter a store,
as you will be obliged to do.”</p>

<p>“Ah! I had not thought of that,” murmured
Charlie. “It will, indeed, be a sacrifice;
but, mother, I would not care for that,
if you could only be spared the trials to
which you will be exposed from poverty.”</p>

<p>“Thank you for your consideration, my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
child; but do not fear that I shall not
accommodate myself to it. It is a heavy
trial; but we must try to think that it will
ultimately eventuate in our good.”</p>

<p>At the auction of Mr. Dinsmoor’s house
and furniture, the whole property, without
exception, was knocked off to a young man,
who seemed apparently of twenty-two or
three years of age. He was able to secure
it at a price much beneath its real value;
for times were hard, and money scarce, so
that he had but few competitors. Mr.
Dinsmoor did not hear his name, and the
pressure of sad thoughts prevented his
making the inquiry.</p>

<p>Possession was to be given in one week.
Meanwhile, Mr. Dinsmoor sought out a
small house in an obscure part of the town,
which, in point of elegance and convenience,
formed a complete contrast to the one he had
formerly occupied. He felt, however, that
it would be all his scanty salary as clerk—for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
he had secured a situation in that capacity—would
enable him to afford.</p>

<p>Lizzie looked, with a rueful face, at the
piano, as a dear friend from whom she must
henceforth be separated, it being quite too
costly a piece of furniture to be retained in
their reduced circumstances. Her proficiency
in music, for which she had great
taste, made her regret it doubly, since she
might with it have added to the resources of
the family by giving music lessons.</p>

<p>On the last evening in which they were to
remain in the old house, their sad thoughts
were broken in upon by a ring at the bell.</p>

<p>“Can they not even leave us to enjoy the
last evening in quiet?” said Charles, half
petulantly.</p>

<p>Immediately afterwards, there entered a
young man, in whom Mr. Dinsmoor recognized
the purchaser of the house.</p>

<p>“I need not bid you welcome,” said he,
smiling faintly, “since you have a better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
right here now than myself. Had I been
told, three months since, that this would be,
I would not have believed it; but we cannot
always foresee. I shall be prepared to leave
to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“I shall be better satisfied if you will
remain,” said the young man, bowing.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Simply, that as this house and furniture
are now mine, to do with as I like, I choose
to restore you the latter, and offer you the
use of the former, rent free, as long as you
choose to occupy it.”</p>

<p>“Who, then, are you,” asked Mr. Dinsmoor,
in increasing surprise, “who can be
so kind to utter strangers, with no claim
upon you?”</p>

<p>“You are mistaken. You have a claim
upon me. Shall I tell you what it is?
Eleven years ago to-morrow,—for to-morrow
is Christmas Day,—a poor boy, who had
known none of the luxuries, and but few of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
the comforts, of life, stood in this street.
His mind was ill at ease; for he had lost
his way: but, as he walked on, he beheld
a blaze of light issuing from a window,—from
<em>your</em> window,—and, aroused by curiosity,
he looked in. Around a Christmas-tree,
brilliant with light, a happy group were
assembled. As he stood gazing in, he heard
the front door open; and a gentleman came
out, and kindly invited him to enter. He
did so; and the words of kindness and the
Christmas gift with which he departed have
not yet left his remembrance. Seven years
passed, and the boy’s fortune changed. An
uncle, long supposed to be dead, found him
out, and, when he actually died, left him the
heir of a large amount of wealth. Need I
say that I am that boy, and that my name
is Willie Grant?”</p>

<p>The reader’s imagination can easily supply
the rest. Provided with capital by his young
friend, Mr. Dinsmoor again embarked in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
business; and, this time, nothing occurred to
check his prosperity. Charlie did <em>not</em> leave
college, nor did Lizzie lose her piano. She
gained a husband, however, and had no reason
to regret the train of events which
issued from her <span class="smcap">Christmas Gift</span>.</p>

<h2 id="GOTTFRIED_THE_SCHOLAR">GOTTFRIED THE SCHOLAR.</h2>

<p>Alone in his study sat Gottfried the scholar.
The shelves which lined the apartment on
every side groaned beneath the weight of
bulky quartoes and ponderous folios. The
accumulated learning of many ages and
countries, flowing in diverse channels, had
mingled into one stream, and, with its fertilizing
current, contributed to enrich the
mind of Gottfried. And these many volumes,
couched in languages which to all
but their owner were a sealed book, which
many years’ assiduous labor and midnight
vigils alone could unclose,—these were but
the index of Gottfried’s attainments.</p>

<p>Never in the palmiest days of chivalry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
had knight been more constant to his mistress
than Gottfried to his books. Without
these, life would have been to him a blank,
and the world a desert. What to him were
the companionship of friends, the charms
of social intercourse? He recognized no
friends but his books; and with them alone
he held intercourse. He had cultivated his
intellect to the neglect of his heart: beneath
his fostering care, the former had swelled
into the proportions of a giant; the latter,
like an untilled garden, had been abandoned
to the rank growth of weeds, which had
already overshadowed it, and checked the
growth of kind feelings and human affections.</p>

<p>But of this defect Gottfried was not conscious;
or, at least, he would not have acknowledged
it to be such. With all his
wisdom, he knew not the meaning of virtue;
for he was perpetually confounding it with
learning; so that with him the philosophy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
of life might be said to consist in these few
words: “To be learned is to be virtuous.”
Thus it was, that, in the pride of his attainments,
he looked down upon other men as
immeasurably his inferiors, and was even
half convinced that they were of a different
nature from himself.</p>

<p>He aspired to become in the world of intellect
what Alexander was in the physical
world, and, like that monarch, sighed to
think that there were no more worlds to conquer,—no
more victories to be gained.</p>

<p>Gottfried had just written the concluding
paragraph of a treatise upon some abstruse
subject, which possessed an interest only for
scholars like himself. His pen dropped
wearily from his fingers, and he passed his
hand across his eyes.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said he, musingly, and a smile
lighted up his face, “at length it is finished,
the labor of many years. But the reward is to
come. My fame as a scholar, already great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
among men, will become greater still.
Fame, bright goddess of my youthful
dreams! how through weary years have
I toiled for thee! How willingly have I
resigned those objects on which other men
set their affections! Wealth, pleasure, love,—I
have sacrificed them all to this one
engrossing pursuit. Who shall say that I
have lived in vain?”</p>

<p>Gottfried had labored for many hours
without rest. He took down his scholar’s
cap and cloak from the wall against which
they were suspended, and attired himself
for a walk.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful day. The sun had
passed the meridian, and was shining with
softened splendor on fields decorated with
the green carpet which Nature so bounteously
provides. Here a group of cattle
reposed in tranquil enjoyment beneath the
spreading branches of trees, which afforded
a grateful shelter from the sun’s heat. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
little farther on, a tiny stream was seen rippling
on its way. Beside it were childish
figures playfully plucking the flowers that
grew upon the banks, and tossing them into
the water, where they were soon borne down
the quick current. Children, however
small, have an eye to the beautiful; and
the little group sang and shouted in all
the exuberance of their spirits. The smile
of outward nature was reflected upon the
faces of these little ones.</p>

<p>As Gottfried passed by, one of them, supposing
that all must share in her feelings,
plucked a flower, and, holding it up, exclaimed,
“Is it not pretty?”</p>

<p>“What is pretty?” asked Gottfried, looking
up.</p>

<p>The flower was held up in answer.
“Poh! child: it is only a buttercup.”</p>

<p>The child drew back abashed, and Gottfried
pursued his way. He regarded not
the fair landscape which like a dream of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
beauty opened upon his steps. His mind
was still at home among his books. Indeed,
it rarely passed beyond those four dark
walls wherein all that he cared for in life
was enclosed. With the laws of Nature, so
far as they had been ascertained by human
wisdom, he was thoroughly conversant; but
for Nature itself he cared little. He could
tell you all that science has discovered of
the mysterious courses of the heavenly
bodies; but the finest evening that ever
looked down with its thousand glittering
eyes from the blue vault above vainly
tempted him forth from his study. He
would have regarded it as a mere weakness
to yield to such an impulse. He at least
was in no danger of yielding; for he never
felt the impulse.</p>

<p>Gottfried passed on, plunged as before in
deep thought, of which the treatise which
he had just completed was the absorbing
subject.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>A woman with a babe in her arms,
whose melancholy face and tattered garb
spoke sadly of unhappiness and destitution,
stood in the path. He would not have
noticed her, had she not timidly touched
the hem of his garment.</p>

<p>“Why do you disturb me?” he asked
impatiently, as he looked up. “You have
interrupted the current of my thoughts.
What would you have?”</p>

<p>“I hope, sir,” said the woman, in a low
tone, “you will pardon the interruption.
I would not willingly intrude; but you see
my situation. I am left destitute, and without
friends. For myself, I care not. Perhaps
it is well that I should die; but my
child,—I would live for him.”</p>

<p>Gottfried listened with an unmoved countenance,
and as one who but half comprehended
what he heard.</p>

<p>“If you are poor and in distress,” he
said at length, “you can apply to the proper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
authorities. I have matters of more importance
to attend to.”</p>

<p>“Of more importance than the life of
a fellow-creature?” interrupted a rough-looking
man, in a farmer’s dress, who had
just stepped up. “Nay, then, I have not.
Come with me, my poor woman. I live in
the cottage yonder. It is but a poor place;
but it will afford you food and shelter.”</p>

<p>“Such men,” mused Gottfried, “do not
estimate the superiority of science over the
trivial objects upon which most waste their
lives to little purpose. But how should
they? They pass their lives in a round of
petty duties and petty employments, above
and beyond which they care not to look.”</p>

<p>Such were the meditations of Gottfried.
Ah! thou that canst see the mote in thy
brother’s eye, and dost not discern the beam
that is in thine own!</p>

<p>Gottfried was approaching his study on
his return from the walk, when his meditations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
were disturbed by a cry which always
makes the blood course more quickly
through the veins,—the fearful cry of
“Fire!” Voice after voice took up the cry
till it swelled into a terrible and confused
clamor. Fire! Gottfried looked up, and,
to his inexpressible consternation, beheld
the flames rapidly consuming his own dwelling.
The conviction flashed upon him, with
the speed of lightning, that he had left a
candle burning which he had lighted for the
purpose of sealing a letter. Undoubtedly
it had come in contact with the loose papers
which lay about it, and <em>this</em> was the result.</p>

<p>“My books! my treatise!” exclaimed
Gottfried with anguish, as he contemplated
the probability of their destruction. “They
will all be consumed!”</p>

<p>He hurried to the scene of disaster. The
firemen were plying their utmost efforts to
bring the flames under. But the fire had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
already made such headway that they struggled
against hope.</p>

<p>Gottfried lent his aid with the energy of
despair. Finally, unable to conceal from
himself that the building must be consumed,
he rushed into the crackling flames,
in the hope of at least rescuing the manuscript
of which he had written that day the
concluding paragraphs.</p>

<p>It was a mad effort, such as nothing but
despair could prompt. The smoke stifled
him; the flames scorched and burned him.
He was dragged out by main force, having
succeeded in passing but a few feet beyond
the threshold. Luckily he was in a state of
insensibility, so that the last scenes in the
conflagration passed without his knowledge.</p>

<p>The weeks that succeeded were a blank
to Gottfried, for he was plunged in the
delirium of a brain fever. When, at length,
he awoke to consciousness, it was in a small
and poorly-furnished chamber. At the bedside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
was seated a woman, coarsely but neatly
attired.</p>

<p>“Where am I?” he inquired, bewildered.
“What has happened to me?”</p>

<p>“You are at length better, thank Heaven,”
said the woman, earnestly, “since the delirium
has left you.”</p>

<p>“Delirium!” said Gottfried, raising himself
on his elbow in surprise. “Oh, yes!
I now recall the fearful calamity which has
befallen me. My books,—are they all
gone? Is there not one left?”</p>

<p>“Yes, one was saved.”</p>

<p>“What is it? Bring it to me.”</p>

<p>From a shelf near by, the attendant took
down a small volume which had been
scorched, but not otherwise injured, by the
flames.</p>

<p>He opened it. It proved to be the New
Testament in the original tongue. Perhaps
out of his whole library this was the book
which he had least studied. Now, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
that it was all that was left him, he
passed hours in its perusal. Gradually, as
he read, a light broke in upon him; and he
began to perceive, at first by glimpses, but
after a while with all the clearness of light,
that his life had been a mistake, and that
learning was not, as he had fancied, the
great end of existence. He perceived that
in its attainment he had neglected what were
of infinitely more importance,—his duties
to God and his fellow-men. With a feeling
of humiliation, he could not but confess that
his life had been in vain.</p>

<p>One day, as he was rapidly approaching
recovery, he turned to his nurse, and said,
abruptly,—</p>

<p>“Where have I met you before? Your
face looks familiar.”</p>

<p>“On the day of the fire,” was the reply,
“you met me and my little one. We were
destitute, and implored charity.”</p>

<p>“Which I denied. Yet you nurse me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
with all the devotedness of one who is serving
a benefactor. How is this?”</p>

<p>“I am only doing my duty. But it is
not to me you are indebted: it is to the
good farmer whose hospitality we both alike
share.”</p>

<p>“Is it possible?” said Gottfried, with
humiliation. “It is, then, he over whom I
triumphed in fancied superiority. With all
the learning which I have gathered from
books, I feel, that, in the true wisdom of
life, I am vastly inferior to you both.”</p>

<p>On his recovery, Gottfried again applied
himself to his studies; but henceforth he
never sought to elevate mere worldly knowledge
above “that wisdom which passeth all
understanding.”</p>

<h2 id="PETER_PLUNKETTS_ADVENTURE">PETER PLUNKETT’S ADVENTURE.</h2>

<p>Some years since, there lived in Portland a
worthy shoemaker named Peter Plunkett.
Unpoetical as his name may appear, Peter
possessed a vivid imagination, which, had it
been properly cultivated, might have made
him, perchance, a poet or a novelist. As it
was, he chiefly employed it in building air-castles
of more than royal magnificence,
wherein dwelt fairies and genii. If there
was any book that approached the Bible, in
Peter’s estimation, it was the “Arabian
Nights’ Entertainments.” He had a devout
belief in all the marvellous stories<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
which it contains, and often sighed in secret
that it had not been his fortune to live in
the days of that potent monarch,—the Caliph
Haroun Al Raschid.</p>

<p>Peter Plunkett’s peculiarity was well
known. Indeed, his mind was most of the
time far back in the golden age of fairies,
so that he would sometimes be guilty of
amusing mistakes. On one occasion, he
addressed his housekeeper as “Most charming
princess!” whereupon the good woman
was led to entertain serious doubts as to his
sanity, which, indeed, were not wholly unreasonable,
since, though an excellent cook,
she certainly did not look much like a princess.</p>

<p>Not far from Peter’s shop lived Squire
Eveleth, who, being mirthfully inclined,
resolved to take advantage of the worthy
shoemaker’s fancies, and play upon him a
practical joke.</p>

<p>Happening into Peter’s shop, he led the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
conversation to the subject of genii. “I
have sometimes thought,” said he, gravely,
“that the fairies and genii have not yet
abandoned the earth, but still continue, invisibly
to us, to exercise an influence over
our destinies.”</p>

<p>“So have I,” said Peter, eagerly. “Many
a time I have fancied, as I sat here at work,
that I could hear the rushing of their wings
as they circled about me; and I have sometimes
invoked them to appear in visible
form; but they never have.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps they will some time,” said the
squire, encouragingly. “I wish you would
come and take tea with me to-morrow,” he
continued, after a pause. “I should like
to confer with you about these things.”</p>

<p>Consent was readily accorded; and the
next afternoon found Peter Plunkett a guest
of the squire. The latter, unperceived,
mingled a potion with Peter’s tea; and
the result was that in half an hour he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
in a sound sleep. In this condition, the
squire had him conveyed in a carriage to
the depot; and, in a few minutes, they were
travelling towards Boston. They reached
the city in the evening; and Peter, still
sleeping, was conveyed to the Revere House,
carried to a bed-chamber, and deposited in
bed. Squire Eveleth then retired, and,
after leaving a note on the table, left the
house; and, after passing the night at another
hotel, returned, in the morning train,
to Portland.</p>

<p>The sun was already high in the heavens
when Peter Plunkett awoke. He gazed,
bewildered, at the unwonted appearance of
the room, and, jumping out of bed, walked
mechanically to the window.</p>

<p>“Surely this can’t be Portland,” he said
to himself, as the towers and steeples of
Boston met his view. “Where am I?
What can have happened to me?”</p>

<p>Turning from the window, his eye rested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
upon a letter lying upon the table, addressed
to himself.</p>

<p>He opened it hastily, and read as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Mortal!</span> be thankful; for to you, in return for
your unquestioning faith, has been vouchsafed a favor
which distinguishes you above your fellow-men. I who
write to you am Aldabaran, the potent genie of the air.
Last night, I snatched you from your couch, in the dead
of night, and bore you hither. You are now at the
Revere House, in Boston. In your pocket you will find
gold, which I have placed there. It will defray all your
expenses, and bear you back to Portland. But beware
lest you divulge to any one the chance that has befallen
you; for, should you be so indiscreet, I swear to you by
Solomon’s seal, which glows with unapproachable splendor,
that you will instantly be transformed into a gigantic
jackass, and be doomed in that shape to walk the earth
for ever as the penalty of your folly.</p>

<p class="center">“Farewell, and beware!</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Aldabaran</span>.”</p>

</div>

<p>As Peter Plunkett read this terrible missive,
his hair stood on end with affright;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
yet, in the midst of his terror, he was filled
with joy at the nature of the favor which
had been granted him.</p>

<p>That night, he returned to Portland.
Many curious inquiries were made of him
as to the object of his journey; for this
was the first time he had left Portland for
many years. To all these inquiries he preserved
an impenetrable silence; merely
shaking his head mysteriously, lest he
should incur the dreadful doom denounced
against him. Henceforth he deemed himself
as one singled out from the great mass
of mankind. Upon his fellow-mortals he
looked with a pitying eye, as beings with
whom the invisible spirits of the air had
never deigned to hold communication.
Happy in his innocent delusion, he would
not exchange places with the most powerful
monarch. Locked up in his trunk are the
gold coins which he found in his pocket in
accordance with the mysterious letter. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
will never spend them; for he regards them
as a fairy gift; and he fancies, that, while
he holds them in his possession, Fortune
will ever smile upon him.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
